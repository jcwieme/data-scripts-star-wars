1
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:32,360
Command station, this is ST-321.
Code clearance blue.

2
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:35,405
We're starting our approach.
Deactivate the security shield.

3
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:38,241
The security deflector shield
will be deactivated...

4
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,660
when we have confirmation
of your code transmission.

5
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:41,953
Stand by.

6
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:45,331
You are clear to proceed.

7
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,751
We're starting our approach.

8
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,864
Inform the commander
that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

9
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,074
Sir.

10
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,947
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected
pleasure. We're honored.

11
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,366
You may dispense
with the pleasantries, Commander.

12
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,993
I'm here to put you back on schedule.

13
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:07,163
I assure you, Lord Vader,
my men are working as fast as they can.

14
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:10,708
Perhaps I can find new ways
to motivate them.

15
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:15,004
I tell you this station
will be operational as planned.

16
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:21,094
The emperor does not share your
optimistic appraisal of the situation.

17
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:24,430
But he asks the impossible.
I need more men.

18
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:27,684
Then perhaps you can tell him
when he arrives.

19
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:32,438
- The emperor's coming here?
- That is correct, Commander...

20
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:37,360
and he is most displeased with
your apparent lack of progress.

21
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,904
We shall double our efforts.

22
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:43,324
I hope so, Commander, for your sake.

23
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:47,370
The emperor is not as forgiving as I am.

24
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,724
Of course I'm worried.
And you should be too.

25
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:11,644
Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca
never returned from this awful place.

26
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:16,065
Don't be so sure.

27
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,485
If I told you half the things
I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt...

28
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,487
you'd probably short-circuit.

29
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,085
R2, are you sure this is the right place?

30
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,301
I'd better knock, I suppose.

31
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:49,098
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Let's go back and tell Master Luke.

32
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,562
Goodness gracious me!

33
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,255
I don't think
they're going to let us in, R2.

34
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,967
We'd better go.

35
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:34,477
R2, wait.

36
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,523
Oh, dear. R2.

37
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,943
R2, I really don't think
we should rush into all this.

38
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:44,904
Oh, R2!

39
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:46,781
R2, wait for me!

40
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:57,458
Just you deliver Master Luke's message
and get us out of here.

41
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,544
Oh, my!

42
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,632
Oh, no.

43
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,097
Oh, my.

44
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:18,980
We bring a message
to your master, Jabba the Hutt.

45
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,944
And a gift.

46
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,404
What gift?

47
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,176
He says that our instructions
are to give it only to Jabba himself.

48
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,731
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever
so stubborn about these sort of things.

49
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:07,570
R2, I have a bad feeling about this.

50
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,273
Good morning.

51
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,781
The message, R2. The message.

52
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,459
Greetings, Exalted One.

53
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,878
Allow me to introduce myself.

54
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:09,924
I am Luke Skywalker,
Jedi knight and friend to Captain Solo.

55
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:13,344
I know that you are powerful,
mighty Jabba...

56
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:17,140
and that your anger with Solo
must be equally powerful.

57
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:21,102
I seek an audience with Your Greatness
to bargain for Solo's life.

58
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,483
With your wisdom, I'm sure
we can work out an arrangement...

59
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,318
which will be mutually beneficial...

60
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:32,155
and enable us to avoid
any unpleasant confrontation.

61
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:37,410
As a token of my goodwill,
I present to you a gift...

62
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,287
these two droids.

63
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,289
What did he say?

64
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:44,959
Both are hardworking
and will serve you well.

65
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:48,838
This can't be.
R2, you're playing the wrong message.

66
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,221
He's no Jedi.

67
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:03,686
There will be no bargain.

68
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,022
We're doomed.

69
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:13,112
I will not give up my favorite decoration.

70
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:18,034
I like Captain Solo where he is.

71
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,829
R2, look. Captain Solo.

72
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:24,499
And he's still frozen in carbonite.

73
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:40,097
What could possibly
have come over Master Luke?

74
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:45,102
Was it something I did? He never
expressed any unhappiness with my work.

75
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,605
How horrid!

76
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,011
Good. New acquisitions.

77
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:21,764
You are a protocol droid, are you not?

78
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,808
I am C-3PO...

79
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,685
Yes or no will do.

80
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,311
Well, yes.

81
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,939
How many languages do you speak?

82
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,693
I am fluent in over six million forms
of communication and can readily...

83
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,445
Splendid. We have been
without an interpreter...

84
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,907
since our master got angry
with our last protocol droid...

85
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:41,826
and disintegrated him.

86
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,536
Disintegrated?

87
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:52,253
Guard, this protocol droid might be useful.

88
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,547
Fit him with a restraining bolt...

89
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:58,009
and take him back up to
His Excellency's main audience chamber.

90
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,595
R2, don't leave me!

91
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,893
You're a feisty little one...

92
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,479
but you'll soon learn some respect.

93
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:13,899
I have need for you on
the master's sail barge...

94
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:16,736
and I think you'll fill in nicely.

95
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:48,726
Ah! Do that again!

96
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:46,302
I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.

97
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,637
Oh, no. Chewbacca.

98
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:56,979
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.

99
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,571
Yes, I am here, Your Worshipfulness.

100
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,032
Yes?

101
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,251
The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome...

102
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,962
and will gladly pay you
the reward of 25,000.

103
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,049
I want 50,000. No less.

104
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:27,843
"50,000. No less."

105
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,525
What did I say?

106
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:51,534
The mighty Jabba asks
why he must pay 50,000.

107
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,832
Because he's holding a thermal detonator.

108
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:13,639
This bounty hunter is my kind of scum...

109
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:17,393
fearless and inventive.

110
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:29,655
Jabba offers the sum of 35...

111
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,949
and I do suggest you take it.

112
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,123
He agrees!

113
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,712
Just relax for a moment.

114
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,465
You're free of the carbonite.

115
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:40,012
You have hibernation sickness.

116
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:44,600
- I can't see.
- Your eyesight will return in time.

117
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:48,020
- Where am I?
- Jabba's palace.

118
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:52,941
Who are you?

119
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:00,449
- Someone who loves you.
- Leia.

120
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,954
I gotta get you out of here.

121
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,375
What's that?

122
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,005
I know that laugh.

123
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,262
Hey, Jabba.

124
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:25,224
Look, Jabba, I was just
on my way to pay you back.

125
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:28,227
I got a little sidetracked.
It's not my fault.

126
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:32,064
It's too late for that, Solo.

127
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:36,902
You may have been a good smuggler...

128
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:40,489
but now you're bantha fodder.

129
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,161
Look...

130
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,456
Take him away.

131
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,333
Jabba, I'll pay you triple.

132
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,961
You're throwing away a fortune here.
Don't be a fool.

133
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,049
Bring her to me.

134
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,347
We have powerful friends.

135
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,516
You're gonna regret this.

136
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,311
I'm sure.

137
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,192
I can't bear to watch.

138
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,208
Chewie?

139
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,962
Chewie, is that you?

140
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:41,550
Wait a minute. I can't see, pal.

141
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,511
What's going on?

142
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,640
Luke? Luke's crazy.

143
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:52,311
He can't even take care of himself,
much less rescue anybody.

144
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,981
A Jedi knight?

145
00:21:56,816 --> 00:22:00,736
I'm out of it for a little while,
everybody gets delusions of grandeur.

146
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,074
I'm all right, pal.

147
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:09,494
I'm all right.

148
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:05,467
I must speak with Jabba.

149
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,641
No bargain.

150
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,227
You will take me to Jabba now.

151
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,483
You serve your master well.

152
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,362
And you will be rewarded.

153
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:37,499
At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.

154
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,917
Master.

155
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:44,214
Luke Skywalker, Jedi knight.

156
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:48,593
I told you not to admit him.

157
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:50,512
I must be allowed to speak.

158
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,390
He must be allowed to speak.

159
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:57,185
You weak-minded fool!

160
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:03,567
He's using an old Jedi mind trick.

161
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:07,195
You will bring Captain Solo
and the Wookiee to me.

162
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:18,290
Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.

163
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,584
Nevertheless...

164
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:23,670
I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends.

165
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:27,632
You can either profit by this
or be destroyed.

166
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:30,719
It's your choice, but I warn you
not to underestimate my powers.

167
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,057
Master Luke, you're standing on...

168
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:39,770
There will be no bargain, young Jedi.

169
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:44,524
I shall enjoy watching you die.

170
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:18,225
Oh, no! The rancor!

171
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:09,187
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.

172
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:13,525
They will all suffer for this outrage.

173
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,457
Han.

174
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,172
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Together again, huh?

175
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:38,717
- Wouldn't miss it.
- How are we doin'?

176
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:41,511
- Same as always.
- That bad, huh?

177
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:44,139
- Where's Leia?
- I'm here.

178
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:49,227
Oh, dear.

179
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:53,189
His High Exaltedness,
the great Jabba the Hutt...

180
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:56,359
has decreed that you are
to be terminated immediately.

181
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:58,153
Good. I hate long waits.

182
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,116
You will therefore be taken
to the Dune Sea...

183
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,577
and cast into the Pit of Carkoon...

184
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,996
nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.

185
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,331
Doesn't sound so bad.

186
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:13,335
In his belly, you will find a new
definition of pain and suffering...

187
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,546
as you are slowly digested
over 1,000 years.

188
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:20,258
On second thought, let's pass on that.

189
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:21,968
You should have bargained, Jabba.

190
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,224
That's the last mistake you'll ever make.

191
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,486
I think my eyes are getting better.

192
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,739
Instead of a big dark blur,
I see a big light blur.

193
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,785
There's nothing to see.
I used to live here, you know.

194
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:31,746
You're gonna die here, you know.
Convenient.

195
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:34,165
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando.

196
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,626
I've taken care of everything.

197
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:38,795
Great.

198
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:49,264
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.

199
00:30:51,142 --> 00:30:52,475
I'm terribly sorry.

200
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,520
R2, what are you doing here?

201
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,690
I can see you're serving drinks,
but this place is dangerous.

202
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,776
They're going to execute Master Luke,
and if we're not careful, us too.

203
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,614
I wish I had your confidence.

204
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,098
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc...

205
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:35,351
His Excellency hopes
that you will die honorably.

206
00:31:37,188 --> 00:31:39,856
But should any of you
wish to beg for mercy...

207
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,985
the great Jabba the Hutt
will now listen to your pleas.

208
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:53,495
3PO, you tell that slimy piece
of worm-ridden filth...

209
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:56,247
he'll get no such pleasure from us!

210
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:58,166
Right?

211
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,546
This is your last chance.

212
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:05,799
Free us or die.

213
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:13,014
Move him into position.

214
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:39,499
Put him in.

215
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:05,400
Easy, Chewie.

216
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:16,786
Help!

217
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,753
Chewie, you're hit? Where is it?

218
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,303
Han, Chewie!

219
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:34,470
Lando.

220
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:43,938
Boba Fett?

221
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,400
Boba Fett? Where?

222
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,560
- Lando, grab it!
- Lower it!

223
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:24,103
I'm trying!

224
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:48,670
Grab me, Chewie. Grab it!

225
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,643
Grab it. Almost. You almost got it.

226
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,320
Gently, now.

227
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:16,531
Easy. Hold me, Chewie.

228
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,794
Chewie, give me the gun.

229
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,922
- Don't move, Lando.
- Wait! I thought you were blind!

230
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:35,049
I can see a lot better. Don't move.

231
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:36,718
A little higher!

232
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,889
Chewie, pull us up.

233
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:44,559
Up, Chewie. Up.

234
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:48,021
We gotta get out of here.

235
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,523
Not my eyes! R2, help!

236
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:52,567
Quickly, R2!

237
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:55,111
Beast!

238
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,326
Get the gun!

239
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:03,745
Point it at the deck.

240
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,793
Point it at the deck!

241
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:17,133
R2, where are we going?
I couldn't possibly...

242
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:23,806
Come on.

243
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:34,317
- Let's go. Don't forget the droids.
- We're on our way.

244
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:15,608
I'll meet you back at the fleet.

245
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:18,361
Hurry. The Alliance
should be assembled by now.

246
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:21,155
- I will.
- Luke, thanks.

247
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,534
Thanks for coming after me.
Now I owe you one.

248
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:32,667
That's right, R2.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

249
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:41,342
I have a promise to keep...

250
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,427
to an old friend.

251
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:36,063
Rise, my friend.

252
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:46,073
The Death Star
will be completed on schedule.

253
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:49,327
You've done well, Lord Vader.

254
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:55,291
Now I sense you wish to continue
your search for young Skywalker.

255
00:38:57,878 --> 00:38:59,212
Yes, my master.

256
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:02,590
Patience, my friend.

257
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:06,052
In time, he will seek you out.

258
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:10,598
When he does, you must bring him before me.

259
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,017
He has grown strong.

260
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:18,814
Only together can we turn him
to the dark side of the Force.

261
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:20,733
As you wish.

262
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:26,322
Everything is proceeding
as I have foreseen.

263
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:54,642
That face you make...

264
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:58,229
Look I so old to young eyes?

265
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,147
No, of course not.

266
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:02,984
I do.

267
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:08,072
Yes, I do.

268
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:12,910
Sick have I become.

269
00:40:12,995 --> 00:40:14,996
Old and weak.

270
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,585
When 900 years old you reach...

271
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,546
look as good you will not.

272
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:32,555
Soon will I rest.

273
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,808
Yes. Forever sleep.

274
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:39,061
Earned it I have.

275
00:40:39,146 --> 00:40:41,856
Master Yoda, you can't die.

276
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,110
Strong am I with the Force...

277
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,195
but not that strong.

278
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:56,037
Twilight is upon me,
and soon night must fall.

279
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,667
That is the way of things...

280
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,963
the way of the Force.

281
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:09,759
But I need your help.

282
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:13,054
I've come back to complete the training.

283
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,306
No more training do you require.

284
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:18,559
Already know you that which you need.

285
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,939
Then I am a Jedi.

286
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,531
Not yet.

287
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:34,658
One thing remains...

288
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:40,122
Vader. You must confront Vader.

289
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:45,086
Then... only then... a Jedi will you be.

290
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:48,923
And confront him you will.

291
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:55,054
Master Yoda...

292
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:01,227
is Darth Vader my father?

293
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:06,857
Rest I need.

294
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:08,401
Yes.

295
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:09,985
Rest.

296
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:14,031
Yoda, I must know.

297
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:20,579
Your father he is.

298
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:29,422
Told you, did he?

299
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:32,508
Yes.

300
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,637
Unexpected this is.

301
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,099
And unfortunate.

302
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,894
Unfortunate that I know the truth?

303
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:45,312
No.

304
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:52,445
Unfortunate that you rushed to face him...

305
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:55,156
that incomplete was your training...

306
00:42:56,158 --> 00:42:59,702
that not ready for the burden were you.

307
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:03,330
I'm sorry.

308
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:10,045
Remember, a Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

309
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,844
But beware.

310
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:20,514
Anger, fear, aggression...

311
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:23,267
the dark side are they.

312
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:27,730
Once you start down the dark path...

313
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:31,609
forever will it dominate your destiny.

314
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:40,659
Do not...

315
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:48,250
Do not underestimate
the powers of the emperor...

316
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:52,755
or suffer your father's fate you will.

317
00:43:57,177 --> 00:43:59,345
When gone am I...

318
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:03,224
the last of the Jedi will you be.

319
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:11,815
The Force runs strong in your family.

320
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:17,905
Pass on what you have learned.

321
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:29,458
There is...

322
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:32,336
another...

323
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:40,886
Skywalker.

324
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,574
I can't do it, R2.

325
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:49,872
I can't go on alone.

326
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,249
Yoda will always be with you.

327
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,501
Obi-Wan.

328
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,136
Why didn't you tell me?

329
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:08,140
You told me Vader betrayed
and murdered my father.

330
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:13,771
Your father was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

331
00:46:13,855 --> 00:46:17,816
He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader.

332
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:19,443
When that happened...

333
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:22,738
the good man who was
your father was destroyed.

334
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:26,241
So what I told you was true...

335
00:46:26,326 --> 00:46:28,160
from a certain point of view.

336
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:30,746
A certain point of view?

337
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:34,750
Luke, you're going to find
that many of the truths we cling to...

338
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:37,836
depend greatly on our own point of view.

339
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:41,340
Anakin was a good friend.

340
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:43,842
When I first knew him...

341
00:46:43,927 --> 00:46:46,136
your father was already a great pilot...

342
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:49,890
but I was amazed how strongly
the Force was with him.

343
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:53,977
I took it upon myself
to train him as a Jedi.

344
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:58,023
I thought that I could instruct him
just as well as Yoda.

345
00:46:58,108 --> 00:46:59,441
I was wrong.

346
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,277
There is still good in him.

347
00:47:02,362 --> 00:47:05,322
He's more machine now than man...

348
00:47:05,407 --> 00:47:07,282
twisted and evil.

349
00:47:08,952 --> 00:47:11,203
I can't do it, Ben.

350
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,247
You cannot escape your destiny.

351
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:16,625
You must face Darth Vader again.

352
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:19,586
I can't kill my own father.

353
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:25,884
Then the emperor has already won.

354
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:29,179
You were our only hope.

355
00:47:30,432 --> 00:47:32,599
Yoda spoke of another.

356
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:37,271
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.

357
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:40,107
But I have no sister.

358
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:43,152
To protect you both from the emperor...

359
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:46,864
you were hidden from your father
when you were born.

360
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:49,450
The emperor knew, as I did...

361
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:53,287
if Anakin were to have any offspring...

362
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,956
they would be a threat to him.

363
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:01,378
That is the reason why your sister
remains safely anonymous.

364
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:07,885
- Leia is my sister.
- Your insight serves you well.

365
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:12,055
Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.

366
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,558
They do you credit...

367
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:17,811
but they could be made
to serve the emperor.

368
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:42,920
Look at you. A general, huh?

369
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:46,131
Someone must have told them about
my maneuver at the Battle of Tanaab.

370
00:48:46,216 --> 00:48:49,134
Don't look at me, pal.
I just said you were a fair pilot.

371
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:52,221
I didn't know they were looking for
somebody to lead this crazy attack.

372
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:54,515
I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.

373
00:48:55,225 --> 00:48:57,309
Who says they didn't? But I ain't crazy.

374
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:59,228
You're the respectable one, remember?

375
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:10,531
The emperor's made a critical error
and the time for our attack has come.

376
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:15,202
The data brought to us by the Bothan spies
pinpoint the exact location...

377
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,454
of the emperor's new battle station.

378
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:19,373
We also know that the weapon systems...

379
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,750
of this Death Star are not yet operational.

380
00:49:21,835 --> 00:49:24,837
With the imperial fleet
spread throughout the galaxy...

381
00:49:24,921 --> 00:49:26,463
in a vain effort to engage us...

382
00:49:26,548 --> 00:49:28,465
it is relatively unprotected.

383
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,676
But most important of all...

384
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:33,470
we've learned that the emperor himself...

385
00:49:33,555 --> 00:49:35,722
is personally overseeing
the final stages...

386
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:38,350
of the construction of this Death Star.

387
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:43,647
Many Bothans died
to bring us this information.

388
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,526
Admiral Ackbar, please.

389
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:52,781
You can see here the Death Star
orbiting the forest moon of Endor.

390
00:49:52,866 --> 00:49:58,370
Although the weapon systems on this
Death Star are not yet operational...

391
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:02,040
the Death Star does have
a strong defense mechanism.

392
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:05,586
It is protected by an energy shield...

393
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:09,381
which is generated
from the nearby forest moon of Endor.

394
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:18,765
The shield must be deactivated
if any attack is to be attempted.

395
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:24,062
Once the shield is down,
our cruisers will create a perimeter...

396
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:27,107
while the fighters
fly into the superstructure...

397
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:30,193
and attempt to knock out the main reactor.

398
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:36,074
General Calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack.

399
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,492
Good luck.

400
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:41,079
You're gonna need it.

401
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:42,915
General Madine.

402
00:50:43,917 --> 00:50:46,877
We have stolen a small imperial shuttle.

403
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:51,214
Disguised as a cargo ship
and using a secret imperial code...

404
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:56,136
a strike team will land on the moon
and deactivate the shield generator.

405
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:57,512
Sounds dangerous.

406
00:50:57,597 --> 00:50:59,932
Wonder who they found to pull that off.

407
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:03,101
General Solo,
is your strike team assembled?

408
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:07,147
My team's ready. I don't have
a command crew for the shuttle.

409
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:10,359
It's gonna be rough.
I didn't wanna speak for you.

410
00:51:12,779 --> 00:51:16,782
- That's one.
- General, count me in.

411
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:18,825
I'm with you too.

412
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:27,459
- What is it?
- Ask me again sometime.

413
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:31,213
Hi, Han, Chewie.

414
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:34,800
"Exciting"
is hardly the word I would choose.

415
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:53,443
Look, I want you to take her.

416
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:55,112
I mean it. Take her.

417
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:58,657
You need all the help you can get.
She's the fastest ship in the fleet.

418
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:01,118
All right, old buddy.

419
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:03,245
I know what she means to you.

420
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:07,082
I'll take good care of her.
She won't get a scratch.

421
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:09,793
All right?

422
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:11,211
Right.

423
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:20,679
I got your promise. Not a scratch.

424
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:23,015
Would you get going, you pirate?

425
00:52:24,684 --> 00:52:25,892
Good luck.

426
00:52:25,977 --> 00:52:27,477
You too.

427
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:38,613
- Got her warmed?
- Yeah, she's coming up.

428
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:44,911
I don't think the Empire had Wookiees
in mind when they designed her, Chewie.

429
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:57,174
Hey, you awake?

430
00:52:57,258 --> 00:53:00,761
Yeah. I just got a funny feeling,
like I'm not gonna see her again.

431
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,265
Come on, General. Let's move.

432
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:08,727
Right. Chewie, let's see
what this piece of junk can do.

433
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:11,063
- Ready, everybody?
- All set.

434
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:15,442
Here we go again.

435
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,330
All right, hang on.

436
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:47,140
What is thy bidding, my master?

437
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:51,603
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor.

438
00:53:54,524 --> 00:53:59,152
There it will stay until called for.

439
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:04,574
What of the reports of the rebel fleet
massing near Sullust?

440
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:06,701
It is of no concern.

441
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:11,748
Soon the rebellion will be crushed
and young Skywalker will be one of us.

442
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:13,667
Your work here is finished, my friend.

443
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:16,461
Go out to the command ship
and await my orders.

444
00:54:16,546 --> 00:54:18,505
Yes, my master.

445
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:37,315
If they don't go for this, we're gonna
have to get out pretty quick.

446
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:42,195
We have you on our screen now.
Please identify.

447
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:47,576
Shuttle Tydirium requesting
deactivation of the deflector shield.

448
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:57,335
Shuttle Tydirium, transmit
the clearance code for shield passage.

449
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:00,130
Transmission commencing.

450
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:03,258
Now we find out if that code
is worth the price we paid.

451
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:06,553
It'll work. It'll work.

452
00:55:07,889 --> 00:55:10,098
Vader's on that ship.

453
00:55:10,183 --> 00:55:12,058
Don't get jittery, Luke.

454
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:14,436
There are a lot of command ships.

455
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:19,065
Keep your distance, Chewie, but don't
look like you're keeping your distance.

456
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:22,777
I don't know. Fly casual.

457
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:29,910
Where is that shuttle going?

458
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:33,079
Shuttle Tydirium,
what is your cargo and destination?

459
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:37,125
Parts and technical crew
for the forest moon.

460
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:41,963
Do they have a code clearance?

461
00:55:42,715 --> 00:55:45,008
It's an older code, sir, but it checks out.

462
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:47,093
I was about to clear them.

463
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:54,184
I'm endangering the mission.
I shouldn't have come.

464
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:56,603
It's your imagination, kid.

465
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:59,481
Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.

466
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:09,115
Shall I hold them?

467
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:13,036
No. Leave them to me.

468
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,455
I will deal with them myself.

469
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,583
As you wish, my lord. Carry on.

470
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:22,295
They're not going for it, Chewie.

471
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:28,218
Shuttle Tydirium...

472
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,720
deactivation of the shield
will commence immediately.

473
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:33,139
Follow your present course.

474
00:56:33,224 --> 00:56:35,767
Okay. I told you it was gonna work.

475
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,102
No problem.

476
00:57:10,428 --> 00:57:12,512
I told you it was dangerous here.

477
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:31,406
- Should we try and go around?
- It'll take time.

478
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:34,534
This whole party will be
for nothing if they see us.

479
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:39,664
Chewie and I will take care of this.
You stay here.

480
00:57:39,749 --> 00:57:42,459
Quietly. There might be
more of them out there.

481
00:57:42,543 --> 00:57:43,960
Hey...

482
00:57:44,045 --> 00:57:45,378
it's me.

483
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:12,989
Go for help! Go!

484
00:58:13,074 --> 00:58:14,616
Great. Come on!

485
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:32,133
Over there! Two more of them.

486
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:35,470
I see them. Wait. Leia!

487
00:58:39,308 --> 00:58:40,809
Hey, wait!

488
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:49,609
Quick, jam their comlink. Center switch.

489
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:02,789
Move closer.

490
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:06,751
Get alongside that one.

491
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,253
Keep on that one. I'll take these two.

492
01:02:04,138 --> 01:02:05,972
General Solo, somebody's coming.

493
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:20,445
Where's Leia?

494
01:02:21,155 --> 01:02:23,698
- She didn't come back?
- I thought she was with you.

495
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:26,326
We got separated.
We better go look for her.

496
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:29,495
Take the squad ahead. We'll meet
at the shield generator at 0300.

497
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,664
Come on, R2. We'll need your scanners.

498
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:35,543
Don't worry, Master Luke.
We know what to do.

499
01:02:37,004 --> 01:02:39,172
And you said it was pretty here.

500
01:03:01,904 --> 01:03:03,863
Cut it out.

501
01:03:20,631 --> 01:03:22,757
I'm not gonna hurt you.

502
01:03:30,766 --> 01:03:33,476
Well, looks like I'm stuck here.

503
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:37,772
Trouble is, I don't know where here is.

504
01:03:38,774 --> 01:03:40,775
Maybe you can help me.

505
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:43,736
Come on. Sit down.

506
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:47,865
I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.

507
01:03:49,535 --> 01:03:52,078
All right. You want something to eat?

508
01:03:58,794 --> 01:04:00,294
That's right.

509
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:06,926
Come on.

510
01:04:27,114 --> 01:04:28,531
Look. It's a hat.

511
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:30,616
It's not gonna hurt you. Look.

512
01:04:37,458 --> 01:04:39,709
You're a jittery little thing, aren't you?

513
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:46,466
What is it?

514
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:27,465
Freeze!

515
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:29,842
Come on. Get up.

516
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:37,016
- Get your ride. Take her back to base.
- Yes, sir.

517
01:05:41,772 --> 01:05:43,022
What the...

518
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:02,625
Come on. Let's get out of here.

519
01:06:44,376 --> 01:06:47,503
I told you to remain on the command ship.

520
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:53,968
A small rebel force has penetrated
the shield and landed on Endor.

521
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,263
Yes, I know.

522
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:01,017
My son is with them.

523
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:07,315
- Are you sure?
- I have felt him, my master.

524
01:07:08,734 --> 01:07:11,277
Strange that I have not.

525
01:07:12,821 --> 01:07:18,075
I wonder if your feelings
on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.

526
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,953
They are clear, my master.

527
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:25,333
Then you must go to
the sanctuary moon and wait for him.

528
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:28,461
He will come to me?

529
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:33,049
I have foreseen it.

530
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:37,219
His compassion for you will be his undoing.

531
01:07:37,304 --> 01:07:41,307
He will come to you,
and then you will bring him before me.

532
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:43,643
As you wish.

533
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:06,624
Master Luke.

534
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:13,047
There's two more wrecked speeders
back there.

535
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:15,132
And I found this.

536
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:20,972
I'm afraid that R2's sensors
can find no trace of Princess Leia.

537
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:25,017
I hope she's all right.

538
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:31,148
What, Chewie?

539
01:08:33,652 --> 01:08:35,653
What, Chewie?

540
01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:52,670
I don't get it. It's just a dead animal.

541
01:08:53,422 --> 01:08:55,381
Chewie, wait! Don't!

542
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:01,345
Nice work.

543
01:09:03,098 --> 01:09:04,974
Great, Chewie.

544
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:07,184
Great. Always thinking with your stomach.

545
01:09:07,269 --> 01:09:10,479
Take it easy. Let's just figure
a way to get out of this thing.

546
01:09:10,564 --> 01:09:12,314
Han, can you reach my lightsaber?

547
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:13,899
Yeah. Sure.

548
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:23,492
R2, I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

549
01:09:23,577 --> 01:09:25,619
It's a very long drop!

550
01:10:08,497 --> 01:10:11,457
Hey. Point that thing someplace else.

551
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:17,129
Hey!

552
01:10:17,214 --> 01:10:19,757
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

553
01:10:25,931 --> 01:10:28,432
Chewie, give them your crossbow.

554
01:10:30,477 --> 01:10:32,144
Oh, my head.

555
01:10:36,358 --> 01:10:38,192
Oh, my goodness.

556
01:11:09,975 --> 01:11:11,934
Do you understand anything they're saying?

557
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:13,477
Oh, yes, Master Luke.

558
01:11:13,562 --> 01:11:16,397
Remember that I am fluent
in over six million forms...

559
01:11:16,481 --> 01:11:18,190
What are you telling them?

560
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:21,443
"Hello," I think.

561
01:11:21,528 --> 01:11:24,613
I could be mistaken...
they're using a very primitive dialect...

562
01:11:24,698 --> 01:11:28,325
but I do believe they think
I am some sort of god.

563
01:11:32,539 --> 01:11:37,084
Why don't you use your divine
influence and get us out of this?

564
01:11:37,169 --> 01:11:40,087
I beg your pardon, General Solo,
but that just wouldn't be proper.

565
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:42,464
Proper?

566
01:11:42,549 --> 01:11:45,217
It's against my programming
to impersonate a deity.

567
01:11:45,302 --> 01:11:46,594
Why, you...

568
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:56,353
My mistake.

569
01:11:57,981 --> 01:11:59,982
He's an old friend of mine.

570
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:28,510
Hey.

571
01:12:45,654 --> 01:12:48,155
I have a really bad feeling about this.

572
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:10,761
What did he say?

573
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:13,222
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo...

574
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:16,850
but it appears you are to be the main
course at a banquet in my honor.

575
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:36,745
Your Royal Highness.

576
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:38,664
These are my friends.

577
01:13:41,668 --> 01:13:45,963
3PO, tell them they must be set free.

578
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:06,900
Somehow I got the feeling
that didn't help us very much.

579
01:14:06,985 --> 01:14:10,946
3PO, tell them if they don't do
as you wish...

580
01:14:11,031 --> 01:14:13,032
you'll become angry and use your magic.

581
01:14:13,116 --> 01:14:15,534
But, Master Luke, what magic?
I couldn't possibly...

582
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:17,202
Tell them.

583
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:35,220
You see, Master Luke?
They didn't believe me...

584
01:14:35,305 --> 01:14:36,930
just as I said they wouldn't.

585
01:14:37,015 --> 01:14:38,349
Wait.

586
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:48,901
What's happening?

587
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,991
Put me down! Help!

588
01:14:56,076 --> 01:14:57,701
Somebody!

589
01:14:57,786 --> 01:14:59,119
Somebody help!

590
01:14:59,204 --> 01:15:01,955
Master Luke! R2, quickly!

591
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:35,114
Thank goodness.

592
01:15:47,377 --> 01:15:49,128
Thanks, 3PO.

593
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:52,297
I never knew I had it in me.

594
01:15:59,848 --> 01:16:01,348
...Tatooine...

595
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:05,185
Princess Leia... R2.

596
01:16:07,313 --> 01:16:08,814
...Darth Vader!

597
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:13,694
...Death Star.

598
01:16:16,656 --> 01:16:18,949
...Jedi... Obi-Wan Kenobi.

599
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:26,457
Yes, R2, I was just coming to that.

600
01:16:29,836 --> 01:16:30,878
Master Luke...

601
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:41,180
...Millennium Falcon ... Cloud City.

602
01:16:43,808 --> 01:16:44,933
...Vader!

603
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:47,227
Han Solo...

604
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:50,856
...carbon.

605
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,692
...Sarlacc.

606
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:18,217
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

607
01:17:31,898 --> 01:17:34,608
Wonderful. We are now a part of the tribe.

608
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:37,903
Just what I always wanted.

609
01:17:49,666 --> 01:17:52,042
Short help's better than
no help at all, Chewie.

610
01:17:57,590 --> 01:18:00,717
The scouts will show us the quickest
way to the shield generator.

611
01:18:00,802 --> 01:18:02,928
Good. How far is it?

612
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:04,513
Ask him.

613
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:08,016
We need some fresh supplies too.

614
01:18:08,101 --> 01:18:10,102
Try and get our weapons back.

615
01:18:11,521 --> 01:18:13,772
Hurry up. I haven't got all day.

616
01:18:16,234 --> 01:18:18,151
Luke, what's wrong?

617
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:23,532
Leia, do you remember your mother...

618
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:25,701
your real mother?

619
01:18:25,785 --> 01:18:29,329
Just a little bit.
She died when I was very young.

620
01:18:29,414 --> 01:18:31,373
What do you remember?

621
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:34,084
Just images really. Feelings.

622
01:18:34,168 --> 01:18:35,669
Tell me.

623
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:40,549
She was... very beautiful.

624
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:43,302
Kind... but sad.

625
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:48,265
Why are you asking me this?

626
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:50,851
I have no memory of my mother.

627
01:18:51,853 --> 01:18:53,937
I never knew her.

628
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:57,858
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?

629
01:19:02,739 --> 01:19:06,617
Vader is here. Now. On this moon.

630
01:19:08,161 --> 01:19:09,911
How do you know?

631
01:19:09,996 --> 01:19:11,955
I felt his presence.

632
01:19:12,832 --> 01:19:16,209
He's come for me.
He can feel when I'm near.

633
01:19:16,294 --> 01:19:18,253
That's why I have to go.

634
01:19:18,338 --> 01:19:21,840
As long as I stay, I'm endangering
the group and our mission here.

635
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:25,844
- I have to face him.
- Why?

636
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:32,726
He's my father.

637
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:38,231
Your father?

638
01:19:39,567 --> 01:19:43,612
There's more. It won't be easy
for you to hear it, but you must.

639
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:46,573
If I don't make it back,
you're the only hope for the Alliance.

640
01:19:46,658 --> 01:19:48,200
Don't talk that way.

641
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:52,829
You have a power I don't understand
and could never have.

642
01:19:52,914 --> 01:19:54,956
You're wrong, Leia.

643
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:56,917
You have that power too.

644
01:19:57,001 --> 01:20:00,379
In time, you'll learn to use it as I have.

645
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:07,260
The Force is strong in my family.

646
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,722
My father has it.

647
01:20:12,058 --> 01:20:14,017
I have it.

648
01:20:14,102 --> 01:20:15,435
And...

649
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:19,147
my sister has it.

650
01:20:25,405 --> 01:20:28,573
Yes. It's you, Leia.

651
01:20:33,788 --> 01:20:35,288
I know.

652
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:39,751
Somehow...

653
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:43,213
I've always known.

654
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:45,298
Then you know why I have to face him.

655
01:20:47,218 --> 01:20:49,845
Luke, run away. Far away.

656
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:53,306
If he can feel your presence,
then leave this place.

657
01:20:53,391 --> 01:20:56,685
- I wish I could go with you.
- No, you don't.

658
01:20:56,769 --> 01:20:58,770
You've always been strong.

659
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:02,357
But why must you confront him?

660
01:21:02,442 --> 01:21:06,194
Because there is good in him. I've felt it.

661
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:08,321
He won't turn me over to the emperor.

662
01:21:08,406 --> 01:21:11,575
I can save him. I can turn him
back to the good side.

663
01:21:12,952 --> 01:21:14,786
I have to try.

664
01:21:33,264 --> 01:21:35,265
Hey, what's going on?

665
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:40,312
Nothing. I just wanna
be alone for a little while.

666
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:43,148
Nothing?

667
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:47,027
Tell me. What's going on?

668
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:54,367
I can't tell you.

669
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:58,622
Could you tell Luke?
Is that who you could tell?

670
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:17,933
I'm sorry.

671
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:23,271
Hold me.

672
01:23:16,784 --> 01:23:18,702
This is the rebel that surrendered.

673
01:23:18,786 --> 01:23:21,746
Although he denies it,
I believe there may be more of them...

674
01:23:21,831 --> 01:23:24,583
and I request permission
to conduct a further search of the area.

675
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:28,086
He was armed only with this.

676
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:32,090
Good work, Commander.

677
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:34,134
Leave us.

678
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:37,929
Conduct your search
and bring his companions to me.

679
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:41,016
Yes, my lord.

680
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:45,103
The emperor has been expecting you.

681
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:47,939
I know, Father.

682
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:51,776
So, you have accepted the truth.

683
01:23:52,862 --> 01:23:56,406
I've accepted the truth that you were
once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

684
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:59,784
That name no longer has any meaning for me.

685
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:03,288
It is the name of your true self.
You've only forgotten.

686
01:24:03,915 --> 01:24:05,707
I know there is good in you.

687
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:08,460
The emperor hasn't driven it
from you fully.

688
01:24:12,298 --> 01:24:14,633
That was why you couldn't destroy me.

689
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:18,219
That's why you won't bring me
to your emperor now.

690
01:24:25,436 --> 01:24:28,521
I see you have constructed
a new lightsaber.

691
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:35,111
Your skills are complete.

692
01:24:40,201 --> 01:24:44,955
Indeed you are powerful,
as the emperor has foreseen.

693
01:24:49,835 --> 01:24:51,670
Come with me.

694
01:24:53,547 --> 01:24:56,591
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

695
01:24:57,843 --> 01:25:02,597
You don't know the power of the dark side.

696
01:25:02,682 --> 01:25:05,517
I must obey my master.

697
01:25:06,519 --> 01:25:10,063
I will not turn,
and you'll be forced to kill me.

698
01:25:11,232 --> 01:25:14,025
If that is your destiny.

699
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:17,946
Search your feelings, Father.
You can't do this.

700
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:20,699
I feel the conflict within you.
Let go of your hate.

701
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:25,370
It is too late for me, son.

702
01:25:28,249 --> 01:25:32,919
The emperor will show you
the true nature of the Force.

703
01:25:33,004 --> 01:25:36,715
He is your master now.

704
01:25:40,511 --> 01:25:43,138
Then my father is truly dead.

705
01:26:26,015 --> 01:26:30,226
The main entrance to the control bunker is
on the far side of that landing platform.

706
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:34,689
- This isn't gonna be easy.
- Don't worry.

707
01:26:34,774 --> 01:26:37,942
Chewie and me got into a lot of places
more heavily guarded than this.

708
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,911
What's he saying?

709
01:26:47,995 --> 01:26:51,372
He says there's a secret entrance
on the other side of the ridge.

710
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:13,978
Admiral, we're in position.
All fighters accounted for.

711
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:16,815
Proceed with the countdown.

712
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:20,485
All groups assume attack coordinates.

713
01:27:23,823 --> 01:27:25,824
Don't worry. My friend's down there.

714
01:27:25,908 --> 01:27:28,493
He'll have that shield down on time.

715
01:27:31,288 --> 01:27:33,957
Or this'll be
the shortest offensive of all time.

716
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:39,629
All craft, prepare to jump
into hyperspace on my mark.

717
01:27:39,713 --> 01:27:41,714
All right. Stand by.

718
01:28:01,193 --> 01:28:03,444
Back door, huh? Good idea.

719
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:14,831
It's only a few guards.
This shouldn't be too much trouble.

720
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,797
It only takes one to sound the alarm.

721
01:28:22,882 --> 01:28:25,425
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.

722
01:28:25,509 --> 01:28:28,052
- Oh, my. Princess Leia.
- Quiet.

723
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:31,181
I'm afraid our furry companion...

724
01:28:31,265 --> 01:28:33,433
has gone and done something rather rash.

725
01:28:38,772 --> 01:28:40,899
There goes our surprise attack.

726
01:28:48,157 --> 01:28:50,450
Look, over there! Stop him!

727
01:29:02,213 --> 01:29:05,298
Not bad for a little furball.
There's only one left.

728
01:29:05,382 --> 01:29:07,967
You stay here. We'll take care of this.

729
01:29:09,929 --> 01:29:12,305
I have decided that we shall stay here.

730
01:29:42,169 --> 01:29:43,169
Hey!

731
01:30:47,276 --> 01:30:50,111
Welcome, young Skywalker.

732
01:30:50,195 --> 01:30:52,572
I have been expecting you.

733
01:30:53,574 --> 01:30:55,575
You'll no longer need those.

734
01:31:00,998 --> 01:31:02,915
Guards, leave us.

735
01:31:10,299 --> 01:31:13,801
I'm looking forward
to completing your training.

736
01:31:13,886 --> 01:31:19,015
In time, you will call me master.

737
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:21,684
You're gravely mistaken.

738
01:31:21,769 --> 01:31:23,895
You won't convert me as you did my father.

739
01:31:24,438 --> 01:31:28,483
Oh, no, my young Jedi.

740
01:31:30,569 --> 01:31:34,697
You will find that
it is you who are mistaken...

741
01:31:36,075 --> 01:31:40,244
about a great many things.

742
01:31:41,914 --> 01:31:43,414
His lightsaber.

743
01:31:43,499 --> 01:31:47,418
Ah, yes. A Jedi's weapon.

744
01:31:48,128 --> 01:31:50,588
Much like your father's.

745
01:31:50,672 --> 01:31:55,510
By now you must know your father
can never be turned from the dark side.

746
01:31:55,594 --> 01:31:58,471
So will it be with you.

747
01:31:58,555 --> 01:32:00,515
You're wrong.

748
01:32:00,599 --> 01:32:03,893
Soon I'll be dead... and you with me.

749
01:32:07,272 --> 01:32:11,609
Perhaps you refer to
the imminent attack of your rebel fleet.

750
01:32:12,403 --> 01:32:13,861
Yes.

751
01:32:13,946 --> 01:32:19,117
I assure you we are quite safe
from your friends here.

752
01:32:20,244 --> 01:32:23,162
Your overconfidence is your weakness.

753
01:32:23,247 --> 01:32:26,416
Your faith in your friends is yours.

754
01:32:28,919 --> 01:32:32,588
It is pointless to resist, my son.

755
01:32:36,552 --> 01:32:42,056
Everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design.

756
01:32:42,141 --> 01:32:45,393
Your friends up there
on the sanctuary moon...

757
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:49,856
are walking into a trap,
as is your rebel fleet.

758
01:32:51,733 --> 01:32:54,277
It was I who allowed the Alliance...

759
01:32:54,361 --> 01:32:57,822
to know the location
of the shield generator.

760
01:32:57,906 --> 01:33:01,993
It is quite safe
from your pitiful little band.

761
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:06,372
An entire legion
of my best troops awaits them.

762
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:12,628
I'm afraid the deflector shield...

763
01:33:12,713 --> 01:33:17,967
will be quite operational
when your friends arrive.

764
01:33:21,472 --> 01:33:22,847
All right!

765
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,474
Up! Move!

766
01:33:24,558 --> 01:33:26,058
Quickly. Quickly.

767
01:33:30,522 --> 01:33:32,190
Han, hurry.

768
01:33:32,274 --> 01:33:34,192
The fleet will be here any moment.

769
01:33:35,861 --> 01:33:38,196
Charges. Come on. Come on!

770
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,158
Oh, my. They'll be captured.

771
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:46,704
Wait! Come back!

772
01:33:49,166 --> 01:33:51,042
R2, stay with me.

773
01:33:52,044 --> 01:33:53,711
Freeze!

774
01:33:57,007 --> 01:33:59,008
You rebel scum.

775
01:34:18,654 --> 01:34:22,073
- All wings report in.
- Red Leader standing by.

776
01:34:22,157 --> 01:34:25,409
- Gray Leader standing by.
- Green Leader standing by.

777
01:34:26,203 --> 01:34:28,371
Lock S-foils in attack positions.

778
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,168
May the Force be with us.

779
01:34:37,714 --> 01:34:40,758
We've gotta be able to get
a reading on that shield... up or down.

780
01:34:42,386 --> 01:34:45,096
How could they be jamming us
if they don't know...

781
01:34:46,098 --> 01:34:47,723
if we're coming.

782
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:51,352
Break off the attack.
The shield is still up.

783
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:53,563
I get no reading. You sure?

784
01:34:53,647 --> 01:34:55,898
Pull up! All craft pull up!

785
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:04,323
Take evasive action. Green Group,
stick close to Holding Sector MV-7.

786
01:35:06,118 --> 01:35:08,911
Admiral, we have enemy ships in Sector 47.

787
01:35:08,996 --> 01:35:10,580
It's a trap.

788
01:35:14,084 --> 01:35:16,085
Fighters coming in.

789
01:35:19,506 --> 01:35:20,923
There's too many.

790
01:35:24,177 --> 01:35:27,597
Accelerate to attack speed.
Draw their fire away from the cruisers.

791
01:35:27,681 --> 01:35:28,806
Copy, Gold Leader.

792
01:35:32,144 --> 01:35:33,686
Come, boy.

793
01:35:34,521 --> 01:35:36,522
See for yourself.

794
01:35:39,151 --> 01:35:44,405
From here, you will witness
the final destruction of the Alliance...

795
01:35:44,489 --> 01:35:48,367
and the end
of your insignificant rebellion.

796
01:35:53,582 --> 01:35:56,000
You want this...

797
01:35:56,710 --> 01:35:58,628
don't you?

798
01:35:58,712 --> 01:36:03,299
The hate is swelling in you now.

799
01:36:04,009 --> 01:36:06,218
Take your Jedi weapon.

800
01:36:06,303 --> 01:36:08,095
Use it.

801
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:10,181
I am unarmed.

802
01:36:10,265 --> 01:36:12,183
Strike me down with it.

803
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:14,852
Give in to your anger.

804
01:36:15,854 --> 01:36:21,025
With each passing moment
you make yourself more my servant.

805
01:36:27,574 --> 01:36:29,617
It is unavoidable.

806
01:36:30,619 --> 01:36:32,870
It is your destiny.

807
01:36:33,872 --> 01:36:37,083
You, like your father...

808
01:36:37,167 --> 01:36:38,793
are now...

809
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:41,337
mine.

810
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:01,857
All right, move it.

811
01:37:09,783 --> 01:37:11,450
Hello. I say, over there.

812
01:37:12,202 --> 01:37:14,578
Were you looking for me?

813
01:37:15,872 --> 01:37:17,957
Bring those two down here.

814
01:37:25,549 --> 01:37:29,885
They're on their way.
R2, are you sure this was a good idea?

815
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:31,345
Freeze.

816
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:32,596
Don't move.

817
01:37:32,681 --> 01:37:34,640
We surrender.

818
01:39:40,267 --> 01:39:42,184
The code's changed.

819
01:39:42,269 --> 01:39:44,687
- We need R2.
- Here's the terminal.

820
01:39:44,771 --> 01:39:46,814
R2, where are you?

821
01:39:46,898 --> 01:39:48,899
We need you at the bunker right away.

822
01:39:50,944 --> 01:39:52,528
Going? What do you mean?

823
01:39:54,155 --> 01:39:55,823
Going where, R2?

824
01:39:55,907 --> 01:40:00,160
Wait. R2, this is no time for heroics.

825
01:40:00,245 --> 01:40:01,954
Come back!

826
01:40:28,148 --> 01:40:29,982
Watch yourself, Wedge. Three from above.

827
01:40:30,066 --> 01:40:33,068
- Red Three, Red Two, pull in.
- Got it.

828
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:38,032
Three of them coming in, 20 degrees.

829
01:40:38,116 --> 01:40:39,909
Cut left. I'll take the leader.

830
01:40:48,168 --> 01:40:49,960
They're heading for the medical frigate.

831
01:40:54,925 --> 01:40:56,175
Pressure's steady.

832
01:41:05,310 --> 01:41:08,646
Only the fighters are attacking.
What are the Stardestroyers waiting for?

833
01:41:13,234 --> 01:41:14,985
We're in attack position, sir.

834
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:18,280
- Hold here.
- We're not going to attack?

835
01:41:18,365 --> 01:41:21,700
My orders are from the emperor himself.
He has something special planned.

836
01:41:21,785 --> 01:41:23,786
We only need to keep them from escaping.

837
01:41:25,413 --> 01:41:29,541
As you can see, my young apprentice...

838
01:41:29,626 --> 01:41:32,878
your friends have failed.

839
01:41:33,672 --> 01:41:36,090
Now witness the firepower...

840
01:41:36,174 --> 01:41:41,553
of this fully armed
and operational battle station.

841
01:41:42,681 --> 01:41:45,265
Fire at will, Commander.

842
01:41:52,232 --> 01:41:54,024
Fire.

843
01:42:00,573 --> 01:42:03,200
That blast came from the Death Star.

844
01:42:04,077 --> 01:42:06,453
That thing's operational.

845
01:42:06,538 --> 01:42:08,414
Home 1, this is Gold Leader.

846
01:42:08,498 --> 01:42:10,624
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.

847
01:42:10,709 --> 01:42:12,960
You won't get another chance at this,
Admiral.

848
01:42:13,044 --> 01:42:15,838
We have no choice, General Calrissian.

849
01:42:15,922 --> 01:42:19,258
Our cruisers can't repel
firepower of that magnitude.

850
01:42:19,342 --> 01:42:23,053
Han will have that shield down.
We've gotta give him more time.

851
01:42:41,865 --> 01:42:43,365
We're coming.

852
01:42:49,164 --> 01:42:50,497
Come on.

853
01:42:54,294 --> 01:42:55,753
R2, hurry!

854
01:43:01,718 --> 01:43:02,760
My goodness!

855
01:43:08,767 --> 01:43:10,726
Why did you have to be so brave?

856
01:43:13,938 --> 01:43:16,523
Well, I suppose
I could hot-wire this thing.

857
01:43:16,608 --> 01:43:18,108
I'll cover you.

858
01:43:59,651 --> 01:44:02,152
Yes, I said closer.
Move as close as you can...

859
01:44:02,237 --> 01:44:04,988
and engage those Stardestroyers
at point-blank range.

860
01:44:05,073 --> 01:44:08,534
At that close range, we won't last long
against those Stardestroyers.

861
01:44:08,618 --> 01:44:11,286
We'll last longer than we will
against that Death Star...

862
01:44:11,371 --> 01:44:13,664
and we might take a few of them with us.

863
01:44:16,543 --> 01:44:17,960
She's gonna blow!

864
01:44:21,965 --> 01:44:23,632
I'm hit!

865
01:44:28,721 --> 01:44:30,931
Your fleet is lost...

866
01:44:31,015 --> 01:44:35,102
and your friends on the Endor moon
will not survive.

867
01:44:37,355 --> 01:44:39,815
There is no escape...

868
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:42,568
my young apprentice.

869
01:44:44,737 --> 01:44:47,239
The Alliance will die...

870
01:44:49,075 --> 01:44:51,994
as will your friends.

871
01:44:55,540 --> 01:44:56,874
Good.

872
01:44:57,876 --> 01:45:01,170
I can feel your anger.

873
01:45:02,839 --> 01:45:06,383
I am defenseless. Take your weapon.

874
01:45:06,467 --> 01:45:09,636
Strike me down with all of your hatred...

875
01:45:09,721 --> 01:45:14,266
and your journey towards
the dark side will be complete.

876
01:45:53,514 --> 01:45:55,599
- Look!
- Get him off of there.

877
01:47:48,713 --> 01:47:50,756
I think I got it.

878
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:52,174
I got it!

879
01:47:59,390 --> 01:48:00,724
Are you all right?

880
01:48:00,808 --> 01:48:02,726
- Let's see.
- It's not bad.

881
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:04,144
- Freeze!
- Oh, dear.

882
01:48:04,228 --> 01:48:05,771
Don't move.

883
01:48:10,193 --> 01:48:12,986
- I love you.
- I know.

884
01:48:13,071 --> 01:48:14,404
Hands up.

885
01:48:15,531 --> 01:48:16,740
Stand up.

886
01:48:26,542 --> 01:48:28,043
Stay back.

887
01:48:35,927 --> 01:48:38,678
Get down here. She's wounded.

888
01:48:38,763 --> 01:48:40,639
No, wait.

889
01:48:40,723 --> 01:48:42,349
I got an idea.

890
01:48:53,611 --> 01:48:55,153
Good.

891
01:48:55,238 --> 01:48:59,074
Use your aggressive feelings, boy.

892
01:48:59,158 --> 01:49:01,952
Let the hate flow through you.

893
01:49:07,542 --> 01:49:11,169
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

894
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:17,008
I will not fight you, Father.

895
01:49:31,065 --> 01:49:33,942
You are unwise to lower your defenses.

896
01:49:58,801 --> 01:50:01,261
Your thoughts betray you, Father.

897
01:50:01,345 --> 01:50:04,514
I feel the good in you, the conflict.

898
01:50:04,599 --> 01:50:07,142
There is no conflict.

899
01:50:09,437 --> 01:50:11,438
You couldn't bring yourself
to kill me before...

900
01:50:11,522 --> 01:50:13,523
and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.

901
01:50:13,608 --> 01:50:18,195
You underestimate
the power of the dark side.

902
01:50:18,279 --> 01:50:19,946
If you will not fight...

903
01:50:20,031 --> 01:50:22,866
then you will meet your destiny.

904
01:50:34,295 --> 01:50:35,629
Good.

905
01:50:35,713 --> 01:50:37,088
Good.

906
01:50:45,723 --> 01:50:49,392
- Watch out. Squad at .06.
- I'm on it, Gold Leader.

907
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:52,729
Good shot, Red Two.

908
01:50:56,317 --> 01:50:59,444
We're sure in the middle of it now.
Come on, Han, old buddy.

909
01:50:59,529 --> 01:51:01,238
Don't let me down.

910
01:51:05,743 --> 01:51:07,244
It's over, Commander.

911
01:51:07,328 --> 01:51:09,704
The rebels have been routed.
They're fleeing.

912
01:51:09,789 --> 01:51:12,415
We need reinforcements
to continue the pursuit.

913
01:51:13,417 --> 01:51:15,418
Send three squads to help.

914
01:51:15,503 --> 01:51:17,504
- Open the back door.
- Sir.

915
01:51:31,644 --> 01:51:33,103
Throw me another charge.

916
01:51:50,621 --> 01:51:53,456
You cannot hide forever, Luke.

917
01:51:54,667 --> 01:51:56,626
I will not fight you.

918
01:52:00,089 --> 01:52:03,174
Give yourself to the dark side.

919
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:08,805
It is the only way
you can save your friends.

920
01:52:09,807 --> 01:52:11,558
Yes.

921
01:52:11,642 --> 01:52:13,643
Your thoughts betray you.

922
01:52:13,728 --> 01:52:16,313
Your feelings for them are strong...

923
01:52:16,397 --> 01:52:18,315
especially for...

924
01:52:20,443 --> 01:52:21,943
sister.

925
01:52:23,362 --> 01:52:27,741
So you have a twin sister.

926
01:52:27,825 --> 01:52:31,578
Your feelings have now betrayed her too.

927
01:52:31,662 --> 01:52:35,790
Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me.

928
01:52:35,875 --> 01:52:40,337
Now his failure is complete.

929
01:52:41,756 --> 01:52:45,592
If you will not turn to the dark side...

930
01:52:45,676 --> 01:52:48,511
then perhaps she will.

931
01:52:48,596 --> 01:52:49,554
Never!

932
01:53:35,142 --> 01:53:36,893
Good!

933
01:53:41,190 --> 01:53:43,942
Your hate has made you powerful.

934
01:53:45,194 --> 01:53:50,115
Now, fulfill your destiny...

935
01:53:50,199 --> 01:53:54,369
and take your father's place at my side.

936
01:54:09,343 --> 01:54:10,677
Never.

937
01:54:13,723 --> 01:54:15,932
I'll never turn to the dark side.

938
01:54:18,853 --> 01:54:21,730
You've failed, Your Highness.

939
01:54:21,814 --> 01:54:23,815
I am a Jedi...

940
01:54:23,899 --> 01:54:25,984
like my father before me.

941
01:54:33,534 --> 01:54:37,036
So be it, Jedi.

942
01:54:37,246 --> 01:54:39,205
Move! Move!

943
01:54:51,719 --> 01:54:55,638
The shield is down. Commence attack
on the Death Star's main reactor.

944
01:54:55,723 --> 01:54:59,517
We're on our way. Red Group,
Gold Group, all fighters follow me.

945
01:54:59,602 --> 01:55:01,603
I told you they'd do it.

946
01:55:08,652 --> 01:55:11,321
If you will not be turned...

947
01:55:11,405 --> 01:55:14,824
you will be destroyed.

948
01:55:21,791 --> 01:55:23,374
Young fool.

949
01:55:24,376 --> 01:55:27,378
Only now, at the end...

950
01:55:27,463 --> 01:55:29,380
do you understand.

951
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:48,358
Your feeble skills are no match
for the power of the dark side.

952
01:55:52,112 --> 01:55:56,032
You have paid the price
for your lack of vision.

953
01:56:01,539 --> 01:56:03,289
Father, please!

954
01:56:18,681 --> 01:56:20,890
Now, young Skywalker...

955
01:56:22,977 --> 01:56:24,811
you will die.

956
01:56:50,337 --> 01:56:52,380
No.

957
01:56:54,508 --> 01:56:56,759
No!

958
01:57:47,561 --> 01:57:49,103
I'm going in.

959
01:57:52,191 --> 01:57:53,483
Here goes nothing.

960
01:58:00,491 --> 01:58:04,452
Lock onto the strongest power source.
It should be the power generator.

961
01:58:06,622 --> 01:58:10,124
Form up. Stay alert.
We could run out of space real fast.

962
01:58:25,724 --> 01:58:27,767
Split up and head back to the surface.

963
01:58:27,851 --> 01:58:31,062
See if you can get a few
of those TIE fighters to follow you.

964
01:58:31,146 --> 01:58:32,188
Copy, Gold Leader.

965
01:58:42,408 --> 01:58:44,033
That was too close.

966
01:58:47,997 --> 01:58:50,206
We've got to give those fighters more time.

967
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:53,376
Concentrate all fire
on that Super Stardestroyer.

968
01:58:59,466 --> 01:59:01,634
Sir, we've lost
our bridge deflector shields.

969
01:59:01,719 --> 01:59:04,762
Intensify the forward batteries.
I don't want anything to get through.

970
01:59:07,224 --> 01:59:09,058
Intensify forward firepower!

971
01:59:10,811 --> 01:59:12,061
Too late!

972
01:59:57,107 --> 02:00:01,027
Help me take this mask off.

973
02:00:01,111 --> 02:00:02,862
But you'll die.

974
02:00:03,864 --> 02:00:07,450
Nothing can stop that now.

975
02:00:08,452 --> 02:00:10,119
Just for once...

976
02:00:10,871 --> 02:00:12,705
let me...

977
02:00:12,790 --> 02:00:16,292
look on you with my own eyes.

978
02:00:52,496 --> 02:00:56,958
Now go, my son.

979
02:00:58,585 --> 02:00:59,961
Leave me.

980
02:01:00,963 --> 02:01:03,589
No. You're coming with me.

981
02:01:03,674 --> 02:01:06,050
I'll not leave you here.
I've got to save you.

982
02:01:06,885 --> 02:01:10,680
You already have, Luke.

983
02:01:11,765 --> 02:01:13,683
You were right.

984
02:01:14,434 --> 02:01:16,811
You were right about me.

985
02:01:18,689 --> 02:01:20,523
Tell your sister...

986
02:01:21,525 --> 02:01:23,860
you were right.

987
02:01:30,826 --> 02:01:31,993
Father.

988
02:01:36,248 --> 02:01:37,665
I won't leave you.

989
02:02:03,025 --> 02:02:04,066
There it is.

990
02:02:06,987 --> 02:02:09,405
Wedge, go for the power regulator
on the north tower.

991
02:02:09,489 --> 02:02:12,867
Copy, Gold Leader.
I'm already on my way out.

992
02:02:32,012 --> 02:02:35,223
Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

993
02:03:22,354 --> 02:03:24,105
They did it!

994
02:03:32,489 --> 02:03:34,991
I'm sure Luke wasn't
on that thing when it blew.

995
02:03:36,660 --> 02:03:38,577
He wasn't.

996
02:03:38,662 --> 02:03:40,371
I can feel it.

997
02:03:45,002 --> 02:03:46,627
You love him.

998
02:03:49,965 --> 02:03:51,424
Don't you?

999
02:03:51,508 --> 02:03:53,009
Yes.

1000
02:03:53,093 --> 02:03:55,845
All right. I understand.

1001
02:03:55,929 --> 02:03:57,346
Fine.

1002
02:03:58,348 --> 02:04:00,182
When he comes back...

1003
02:04:01,184 --> 02:04:03,019
I won't get in the way.

1004
02:04:05,689 --> 02:04:07,690
It's not like that at all.

1005
02:04:11,361 --> 02:04:13,738
He's my brother.

1006
02:05:55,090 --> 02:05:56,757
Wesa free!

1007
02:14:43,952 --> 02:14:44,952
English - US

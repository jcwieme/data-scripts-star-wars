1
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,938
Lock onto him, R2.

2
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:12,484
Master, General Grievous's
ship is directly ahead...

3
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,819
the one crawling with vulture droids.

4
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:17,447
I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.

5
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:27,665
- Oddball, do you copy?
- Copy, Red Leader.

6
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,043
Mark my position.
Form your squad up behind me.

7
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,045
We're on your tail, General Kenobi.

8
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,089
Set S-foils in attack position.

9
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,021
This is where the fun begins.

10
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:52,148
Let them pass between us.

11
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,042
They're all over me.

12
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:14,170
- Get them off my...
- I'm gonna go help them out.

13
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:17,674
No. They are doing their job
so we can do ours.

14
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,565
Missiles. Pull up.

15
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,194
- They overshot us.
- They're coming around.

16
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:48,037
All right, R4. No, no. Nothing too fancy.

17
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,377
Surge all power units, R2.
Stand by reverse thrusters.

18
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,221
We got 'em, R2.

19
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,733
Flying is for droids.

20
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:26,492
- I'm hit. Anakin?
- I see them.

21
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:27,744
Buzz droids.

22
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,378
R4, be careful. You have a...

23
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,425
Oh, dear.

24
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,387
They're shutting down all the controls.

25
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:48,640
Move to the right so I can
get a clear shot at them.

26
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,934
The mission. Get to the command ship.

27
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,478
Get the chancellor.
I'm running out of tricks here.

28
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:00,652
In the name of...

29
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:06,950
- Hold your fire! You're not helping.
- I agree. Bad idea.

30
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:16,125
I can't see a thing. My cockpit's fogging.

31
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,297
They're all over me. Anakin!

32
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:28,012
- Move to the right.
- Hold on. You'll get us both killed.

33
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,475
Get out of here.
There's nothing more you can do.

34
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,769
I'm not leaving without you, Master.

35
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,614
Get him, R2.

36
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,034
Watch out.

37
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:57,000
R2, hit the buzz droid's center eye.

38
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,509
- Yeah, you got him!
- Great, R2.

39
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,722
The general's command ship is dead ahead.

40
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,892
Have you noticed the shields are still up?

41
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,394
Sorry, Master.

42
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,654
I have a bad feeling about this.

43
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,379
There they are. Get them.

44
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,185
R2, locate the chancellor.

45
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,237
The chancellor's signal
is coming from right there...

46
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,407
the observation platform
at the top of that spire.

47
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,451
I sense Count Dooku.

48
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,204
- I sense a trap.
- Next move?

49
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,873
Spring the trap.

50
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,795
R2, go back.
I need you to stay with the ship.

51
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,797
Here. Take this and wait for orders.

52
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:43,606
What's the situation, Captain?

53
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,652
Two Jedi have landed in the main
hangar bay. We're tracking them.

54
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:51,072
Just as Count Dooku predicted.

55
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,286
Destroyers.

56
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,339
Drop your weapons. I said drop 'em.

57
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:10,341
- Roger.
- Roger, roger.

58
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:20,810
Those are Jedi fighters all right.

59
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,401
- Did you press the stop button?
- No. Did you?

60
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,820
There's more than one way out of here.

61
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,781
We don't want to get out.
We want to get moving.

62
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:37,743
R2, activate elevator 31174.

63
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,788
- Come in, R2.
- What that?

64
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:42,790
R2, do you copy?

65
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,335
R2, activate the elevator number 31174.

66
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,173
Get back to work. That nothin'.

67
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,217
Activate the elevator 31174.

68
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,802
R2...

69
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,935
Always on the move.

70
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,022
R2, switch on the comlink.
R2, can you hear me?

71
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,733
R2?

72
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,695
R2! R2!

73
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:20,036
Stop. Stop. R2, we need to be going up.

74
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,373
Hands up, Jedi.

75
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,667
R2, do you copy?

76
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:30,755
R2, do you hear me?
R2, we need to be going up, not down.

77
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:36,886
Hey, you!

78
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,726
That's better.

79
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,396
You stupid little astro droid.

80
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,201
Oh, it's you.

81
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,121
My eyes! My eyes!

82
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:07,583
- What was that all about?
- R2 has been...

83
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,710
- No loose wire jokes.
- Did I say anything?

84
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,754
- He's trying.
- I didn't say anything.

85
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,294
- Chancellor.
- Are you all right?

86
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,878
Count Dooku.

87
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:01,470
- This time we will do it together.
- I was about to say that.

88
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,649
Get help. You're no match for him.
He's a Sith lord.

89
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,820
Chancellor Palpatine,
Sith lords are our speciality.

90
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,781
Your swords, please.

91
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:24,368
We don't want to make a mess of things
in front of the chancellor.

92
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:26,704
You won't get away this time, Dooku.

93
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,634
I've been looking forward to this.

94
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,928
My powers have doubled since
the last time we met, Count.

95
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:46,515
Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.

96
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,578
Get...

97
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:36,899
I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.

98
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,986
You have hate. You have anger.

99
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,698
But you don't use them.

100
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,761
Good, Anakin. Good.

101
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,223
Kill him.

102
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,268
Kill him now.

103
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,817
I shouldn't.

104
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:23,779
Do it.

105
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,753
You did well, Anakin.

106
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:42,047
He was too dangerous to be kept alive.

107
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,259
Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.

108
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,262
I shouldn't have done that.
It's not the Jedi way.

109
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:53,476
It is only natural. He cut off your arm,
and you wanted revenge.

110
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,728
It wasn't the first time, Anakin.

111
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:00,483
Remember what you told me about
your mother and the Sand People?

112
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,864
Now we must leave before
more security droids arrive.

113
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,246
Anakin, there's no time.

114
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,707
We must get off this ship
before it's too late.

115
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,712
- He seems to be all right.
- Leave him, or we'll never make it.

116
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,881
His fate will be the same as ours.

117
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,138
Prepare for attack!

118
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,351
All batteries, fire! Fire!

119
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,321
Elevator's not working.

120
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,702
R2, activate elevator 3224.

121
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:15,683
- Reverse stabilizers.
- Reversing stabilizers.

122
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,079
Magnetize! Magnetize!

123
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,964
Fire the emergency booster engines.

124
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,888
We're leveling out, sir.

125
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,822
Easy. We're in a bit of a situation here.

126
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,533
- Did I miss something?
- Hold on.

127
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,827
- What is that?
- Oops.

128
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:18,913
R2. R2, shut down the elevator.

129
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:20,247
Too late. Jump!

130
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,223
Let's see if we can find something
in the hangar bay that's still flyable.

131
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,434
R2, get down here.

132
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,811
R2, do you copy?

133
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:51,528
General, we found the Jedi.
They're in hallway 328.

134
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:53,989
Activate ray shields.

135
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,243
Ray shields.

136
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:01,246
Wait a minute. How did this happen?
We're smarter than this.

137
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,706
Apparently not.

138
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:07,878
- I say patience.
- Patience?

139
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:11,256
Yes. R2 will be along in a few moments...

140
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:14,093
and then he'll release the ray shields.

141
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,519
See? No problem.

142
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,439
Don't move.

143
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,695
Do you have a plan B?

144
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,704
Ah, yes.

145
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,914
The negotiator.

146
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:48,252
General Kenobi. We've been waiting for you.

147
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,545
Excuse me.

148
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:53,382
- That wasn't much of a rescue.
- You're welcome.

149
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,634
And...

150
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,804
Anakin Skywalker.

151
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:04,643
I was expecting someone with
your reputation to be a little... older.

152
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:11,066
General Grievous.
You're shorter than I expected.

153
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,987
Jedi scum.

154
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,574
We have a job to do, Anakin.
Try not to upset him.

155
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:28,000
Your lightsabers will make
a fine addition to my collection.

156
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,795
Not this time.
And this time, you won't escape.

157
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,921
R2.

158
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,303
Crush them!

159
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,765
Make them suffer!

160
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,479
Come. Now!

161
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,773
Stay at your stations!

162
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,323
Get him! Get him!

163
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,177
Run!

164
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,641
Don't bother with them.

165
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,060
- Keep the ship in orbit.
- Yes, sir.

166
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,989
You lose, General Kenobi.

167
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,890
Get out of here! Run!

168
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,531
Time to abandon ship.

169
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,166
All the escape pods have been launched.

170
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,335
Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?

171
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,172
- You mean, can I land what's left of it?
- Well?

172
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:42,134
Under the circumstances, I'd say the
ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.

173
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,427
Strap yourselves in.

174
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,056
Open all hatches.
Extend all flaps and drag fins.

175
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,950
We lost something.

176
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:09,536
Not to worry.
We are still flying half a ship.

177
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:16,793
Now we're really picking up speed.

178
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,262
Eight plus 60.

179
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:30,682
- We're in the atmosphere.
- Grab that. Keep us level.

180
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,240
Steady.

181
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,410
Easy, R2.

182
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,249
5000.

183
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,292
Fire ships on the left and the right.

184
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:00,128
- We'll take you in.
- Copy that.

185
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:06,301
- Landing strip, straight ahead.
- We're coming in too hot.

186
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,751
Another happy landing.

187
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:11,033
Coming, Master?

188
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:15,579
No. I'm not brave enough for politics.
I have to report to the council.

189
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:18,123
Besides, someone needs
to be the poster boy.

190
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:22,085
Hold on. This whole
operation was your idea.

191
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,339
Let us not forget, Anakin, that
you rescued me from the buzz droids.

192
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,841
And you killed Count Dooku,
and you rescued the chancellor...

193
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,885
carrying me unconscious on your back.

194
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:32,471
All because of your training.

195
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:36,099
Anakin, let's be fair.
Today you were the hero...

196
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:39,603
and you deserve your glorious day
with the politicians.

197
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:43,440
All right. But you owe me one, and not
for saving your skin for the 10th time.

198
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:44,858
Ninth time.

199
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:49,780
That business on Cato Neimoidia doesn't
count. I'll see you at the briefing.

200
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,662
Chancellor Palpatine, are you all right?

201
00:24:57,747 --> 00:25:00,665
Yes. Thanks to your two Jedi knights.

202
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:05,462
They killed Count Dooku, but
General Grievous has escaped once again.

203
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:09,091
General Grievous will run and hide,
as he always does. He's a coward.

204
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:13,512
But with Count Dooku dead,
he is the leader of the droid army.

205
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,514
And I assure you...

206
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:19,351
the senate will vote to continue the war
as long as Grievous is alive.

207
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:23,522
Then the Jedi Council will make
finding Grievous our highest priority.

208
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,900
- Watch it.
- Excuse me.

209
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,986
- Come along, R2.
- The Republic cannot praise you enough.

210
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:32,239
Thank you, Senator Organa.

211
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:35,909
It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.

212
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,537
Now there I agree with you.

213
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:41,373
In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.

214
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:45,710
But the fighting will continue until
General Grievous is spare parts.

215
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,256
I will do everything I can in the senate.

216
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,092
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.

217
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:03,854
Oh, Anakin.

218
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:08,900
I've missed you, Padmé.

219
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:13,321
There were whispers that you'd been killed.

220
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:15,323
I'm all right.

221
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:19,077
It feels like we've been
apart for a lifetime.

222
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:21,997
And it might have been,
if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.

223
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,459
I don't think they would have ever brought
us back from the outer rim sieges.

224
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:28,211
- Wait. Not here.
- Yes, here.

225
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:31,798
I'm tired of all this deception.
I don't care if they know we're married.

226
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:34,176
Anakin, don't say things like that.

227
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:46,605
Are you all right? You're trembling.

228
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,857
What's going on?

229
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:53,111
Something wonderful has happened.

230
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:58,366
Ani, I'm pregnant.

231
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:04,039
That's...

232
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:11,838
That's wonderful.

233
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,718
What are we gonna do?

234
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,598
We're not gonna worry about
anything right now. All right?

235
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,184
This is a happy moment.

236
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,480
The happiest moment of my life.

237
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:37,465
Yes, Lord Sidious?

238
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,467
General Grievous...

239
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:44,681
I suggest you move
the separatist leaders to Mustafar.

240
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,851
It will be done, my lord.

241
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:53,023
The end of the war is near, General.

242
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:56,735
But the loss of Count Dooku...

243
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:00,989
His death was a necessary loss.

244
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:05,410
Soon I will have a new apprentice...

245
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:10,790
one far younger and more powerful.

246
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:40,820
Ani, I want to have our baby
back home on Naboo.

247
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:44,282
We can go to the lake country
where no one will know...

248
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,284
where we can be safe.

249
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:49,829
I can go early and fix up the baby's room.

250
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:57,837
I know the perfect spot.
Right by the gardens.

251
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:05,720
You are so... beautiful.

252
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,391
It's only because I'm so in love.

253
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,145
No, it's because I'm so in love with you.

254
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,191
So love has blinded you?

255
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,696
That's not exactly what I meant.

256
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,324
But it's probably true.

257
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:38,044
Anakin, help me!

258
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,609
What's bothering you?

259
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,030
Nothing.

260
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,326
I remember when I gave this to you.

261
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:55,622
How long is it gonna take for us
to be honest with each other?

262
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,669
- It was a dream.
- Bad?

263
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:06,883
Like the ones I used to have about
my mother, just before she died.

264
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,301
And?

265
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,681
And it was about you.

266
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,560
Tell me.

267
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,856
It was only a dream.

268
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:36,746
You die in childbirth.

269
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:39,666
And the baby?

270
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:42,085
I don't know.

271
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:47,799
- It was only a dream.
- I won't let this one become real.

272
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,553
This baby will change our lives.

273
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,473
I doubt the queen will continue
to allow me to serve in the senate.

274
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:57,976
If the council discovers
you're the father, you'll be expelled...

275
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,019
I know. I know.

276
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:04,399
Do you think Obi-Wan might
be able to help us?

277
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:08,444
We don't need his help.

278
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,782
Our baby is a blessing.

279
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:30,466
Premonitions?

280
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:32,051
Premonitions.

281
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,388
These visions you have...

282
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:40,101
They're of pain, suffering.

283
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,938
Death.

284
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:48,443
Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?

285
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:51,946
Someone.

286
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,948
Close to you?

287
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:56,618
Yes.

288
00:33:57,453 --> 00:34:01,331
Careful you must be when
sensing the future, Anakin.

289
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:05,752
The fear of loss is a
path to the dark side.

290
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,506
I won't let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.

291
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:14,552
Death is a natural part of life.

292
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:19,349
Rejoice for those around you
who transform into the Force.

293
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:22,727
Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not.

294
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,939
Attachment leads to jealousy.

295
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:29,484
The shadow of greed that is.

296
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,819
What must I do, Master Yoda?

297
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:35,573
Train yourself to let go...

298
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:39,118
of everything you fear to lose.

299
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:52,382
You've missed the report
on the outer rim sieges.

300
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:56,094
I'm sorry. I was held up.

301
00:34:56,178 --> 00:35:00,098
- I have no excuse.
- In short, they are going very well.

302
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:05,395
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

303
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,397
What's wrong, then?

304
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:13,695
The senate is expected to vote more
executive powers to the chancellor today.

305
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:18,157
That can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?

306
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:20,702
It'll make it easier for
us to end this war.

307
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:24,747
Be careful of your friend Palpatine.

308
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,292
Be careful of what?

309
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:31,045
- He has requested your presence.
- What for?

310
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,339
He would not say.

311
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:37,010
He didn't inform the council?
That's unusual, isn't it?

312
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:39,345
All of this is unusual.

313
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,806
And it's making me feel uneasy.

314
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,781
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

315
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,034
Of course.

316
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:04,078
I need your help, son.

317
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:07,248
What do you mean?

318
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,917
I'm depending on you.

319
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:12,545
For what? I don't understand.

320
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:18,259
To be the eyes, ears
and voice of the Republic.

321
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:24,724
I'm appointing you to be my personal
representative on the Jedi Council.

322
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,184
Me?

323
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,352
A master?

324
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,606
I'm overwhelmed, sir.

325
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:36,611
But the council elects its own members.
They'll never accept this.

326
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:40,239
I think they will. They need you.

327
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,034
More than you know.

328
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:58,216
Allow this appointment lightly
the council does not.

329
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,761
Disturbing is this move
by Chancellor Palpatine.

330
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,514
I understand.

331
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:06,974
You are on this council...

332
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:09,685
but we do not grant you the rank of master.

333
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:11,813
What?

334
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:20,279
How can you do this? This is outrageous.

335
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:21,948
It's unfair.

336
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:27,161
How can you be on the council
and not be a master?

337
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,790
Take a seat, young Skywalker.

338
00:37:33,836 --> 00:37:35,503
Forgive me, Master.

339
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:42,135
We have surveyed
all systems in the Republic...

340
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:45,972
but have found no sign of General Grievous.

341
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,850
Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is.

342
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:52,061
The outlying systems you must sweep.

343
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:54,397
We do not have many ships to spare.

344
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,691
What about the droid
attack on the Wookiees?

345
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:00,486
It is critical we send
an attack group there immediately.

346
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:04,031
He's right. It's a system
we cannot afford to lose.

347
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,451
Go I will.

348
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:10,580
Good relations with the Wookiees I have.

349
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:12,290
It's settled then.

350
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:17,420
Yoda will take a battalion of clones
to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

351
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,589
May the Force be with us all.

352
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,468
What kind of nonsense is this?

353
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:26,971
Put me on the council
and not make me a master?

354
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,849
It's never been done in the history
of the Jedi. It's insulting.

355
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:32,810
Calm down, Anakin.
You have been given a great honor.

356
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:35,897
To be on the council at your age...
it's never happened before.

357
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:40,443
The fact of the matter is
you are too close to the chancellor.

358
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:44,322
The council doesn't like it
when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

359
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:47,825
I swear to you,
I didn't ask to be put on the council.

360
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,161
But it's what you wanted.

361
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:53,581
Your friendship with Chancellor
Palpatine seems to have paid off.

362
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,583
That has nothing to do with this.

363
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,628
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...

364
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:01,088
is because the chancellor trusts you.

365
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,090
And?

366
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:06,969
Anakin, I am on your side. I didn't
want to put you in this situation.

367
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:08,262
What situation?

368
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:16,687
The council wants you to report on
all the chancellor's dealings.

369
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:19,148
They want to know what he's up to.

370
00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:25,696
They want me to spy on the chancellor?

371
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:29,283
- But that's treason.
- We are at war, Anakin.

372
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,247
Why didn't the council give me
this assignment when we were in session?

373
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:36,791
This assignment is not to be on record.

374
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,836
The chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.

375
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:43,965
He befriended me. He's watched out
for me ever since I arrived here.

376
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,175
That is why you must help us.

377
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,762
Anakin, our allegiance
is to the senate, not to its leader...

378
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:53,557
who has managed to stay in office
long after his term has expired.

379
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:55,643
The senate demanded that he stay longer.

380
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,938
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.

381
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:03,234
You're asking me to do something
against the Jedi code.

382
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:07,238
Against the Republic.
Against a mentor and a friend.

383
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:11,325
That's what's out of place here.
Why are you asking this of me?

384
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,538
The council is asking you.

385
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:26,465
Anakin did not take to his
new assignment with much enthusiasm.

386
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,553
It's very dangerous, putting them together.

387
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,972
I don't think the boy can handle it.

388
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,016
I don't trust him.

389
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:38,936
With all due respect, Master,
is he not the chosen one?

390
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:43,357
Is he not to destroy the Sith
and bring balance to the Force?

391
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:46,319
So the prophecy says.

392
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:51,324
A prophecy that misread could have been.

393
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:55,036
He will not let me down.

394
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,079
He never has.

395
00:40:57,164 --> 00:41:00,207
I hope right you are.

396
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:28,110
Sometimes I wonder what's
happening to the Jedi order.

397
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:32,073
I think this war is destroying
the principles of the Republic.

398
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:37,119
Have you ever considered
that we may be on the wrong side?

399
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:39,121
What do you mean?

400
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:44,418
What if the democracy we thought
we were serving no longer exists...

401
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:48,130
and the Republic has become the very
evil we've been fighting to destroy?

402
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:52,468
I don't believe that.
And you're sounding like a separatist.

403
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,390
This war represents a failure to listen.

404
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:59,517
Now you're closer
to the chancellor than anyone.

405
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:02,895
Please, ask him to stop the fighting
and let diplomacy resume.

406
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,564
Don't ask me to do that.

407
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:10,778
Make a motion in the senate,
where that kind of a request belongs.

408
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,697
- What is it?
- Nothing.

409
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:18,869
Don't do this. Don't shut me out.
Let me help you.

410
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:23,124
Hold me.

411
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,501
Like you did by the lake on Naboo.

412
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:29,338
So long ago, when there was
nothing but our love.

413
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:33,968
No politics, no plotting, no war.

414
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:15,885
- You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
- Yes, Anakin.

415
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:17,970
Come closer. I have good news.

416
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,557
Our clone intelligence units...

417
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:24,727
have discovered
the location of General Grievous.

418
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:27,438
He's hiding in the Utapau system.

419
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:28,731
At last.

420
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:33,319
We'll be able to capture
that monster and end this war.

421
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:36,780
I would worry about
the collective wisdom of the council...

422
00:43:36,865 --> 00:43:39,283
if it didn't select you
for this assignment.

423
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,745
You're the best choice, by far.

424
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:47,249
Sit down.

425
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:48,584
Leave us.

426
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:07,603
You know I'm not able
to rely on the Jedi Council.

427
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:12,733
If they haven't included you
in their plot, they soon will.

428
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:15,778
I'm not sure I understand.

429
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:19,573
You must sense what I have come to suspect.

430
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:23,077
The Jedi Council want
control of the Republic.

431
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,372
They're planning to betray me.

432
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,458
- I don't think that...
- Anakin.

433
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:32,586
Search your feelings.

434
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:37,341
You know, don't you?

435
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,639
I know they don't trust you.

436
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:47,059
Or the senate. Or the Republic.

437
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:49,770
Or democracy, for that matter.

438
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:54,900
I have to admit,
my trust in them has been shaken.

439
00:44:54,985 --> 00:44:56,485
Why?

440
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:02,950
They asked you to do something that
made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

441
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:08,831
They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?

442
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:14,962
I don't...

443
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:17,881
I don't know what to say.

444
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:21,468
Remember back to your early teachings.

445
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:25,973
All who gain power are afraid to lose it.

446
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:30,728
- Even the Jedi.
- The Jedi use their power for good.

447
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:32,980
Good is a point of view, Anakin.

448
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:38,277
The Sith and the Jedi
are similar in almost every way...

449
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,073
including their quest for greater power.

450
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:47,620
The Sith rely on their passion
for their strength.

451
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:50,497
They think inwards...
only about themselves.

452
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,959
And the Jedi don't?

453
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:58,631
The Jedi are selfless.
They only care about others.

454
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:13,771
Did you ever hear the tragedy
of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

455
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:22,946
I thought not. It's not a story
the Jedi would tell you.

456
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:26,367
It's a Sith legend.

457
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:31,497
Darth Plagueis was a
dark lord of the Sith...

458
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:34,500
so powerful and so wise...

459
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:39,463
he could use the Force to
influence the midi-chlorians...

460
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,758
to create... life.

461
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:47,471
He had such a knowledge of the dark side...

462
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:52,059
he could even keep the
ones he cared about...

463
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,645
from dying.

464
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,736
He could actually...
save people from death?

465
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:08,117
The dark side of the Force is
a pathway to many abilities...

466
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:12,454
some consider to be unnatural.

467
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,416
What happened to him?

468
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:18,585
He became so powerful...

469
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:21,964
the only thing he was afraid of was...

470
00:47:23,133 --> 00:47:25,050
losing his power.

471
00:47:25,135 --> 00:47:27,302
Which eventually, of course, he did.

472
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:33,684
Unfortunately, he taught
his apprentice everything he knew.

473
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:37,104
Then his apprentice
killed him in his sleep.

474
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:42,067
It's ironic.

475
00:47:42,152 --> 00:47:44,319
He could save others from death...

476
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:47,531
but not himself.

477
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:54,246
Is it possible to learn this power?

478
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,210
Not from a Jedi.

479
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,979
All Red units, over here!

480
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:33,160
Palpatine thinks General Grievous
is on Utapau?

481
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:35,871
A partial message was intercepted...

482
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:38,457
in a diplomatic packet
from the chairman of Utapau.

483
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:43,128
Act on this we must.

484
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:47,966
The capture of General Grievous
will end this war.

485
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:51,887
Quickly and decisively we should proceed.

486
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:57,017
The chancellor has requested...
that I lead the campaign.

487
00:48:57,769 --> 00:49:00,437
The council will make up
its own mind who is to go...

488
00:49:00,522 --> 00:49:02,523
not the chancellor.

489
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:07,569
A master is needed, with more experience.

490
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:11,073
I concur. Master Kenobi should go.

491
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:13,700
I agree.

492
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:14,952
Aye.

493
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:16,620
Aye.

494
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,664
Very well. Council adjourned.

495
00:49:26,548 --> 00:49:29,258
The droids have started up
their main power generators.

496
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:34,847
- Then now the time is, Commander.
- Yes, sir.

497
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:48,986
Charge!

498
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:06,044
Head for cover!

499
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:24,354
- You're gonna need me on this one.
- I agree.

500
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:27,316
However, it may turn out
just to be a wild bantha chase.

501
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,567
Master.

502
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:35,824
I've disappointed you. I haven't been
very appreciative of your training.

503
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:39,703
I've been arrogant, and I apologize.

504
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:42,789
I've just been so frustrated
with the council.

505
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:49,838
You are strong and wise, Anakin,
and I am very proud of you.

506
00:50:49,923 --> 00:50:52,549
I have trained you since
you were a small boy.

507
00:50:52,634 --> 00:50:54,760
I have taught you everything I know.

508
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:58,639
And you have become a far greater
Jedi than I could ever hope to be.

509
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:01,433
But be patient, Anakin.

510
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:05,479
It will not be long before
the council makes you a Jedi master.

511
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:16,114
Obi-Wan. May the Force be with you.

512
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:19,117
Good-bye, old friend.
May the Force be with you.

513
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:46,269
Fortunately, most of the cities are
concentrated on this small continent here.

514
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:48,021
On the far side.

515
00:51:48,106 --> 00:51:50,440
I'll keep them distracted
until you get there.

516
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:53,986
- Just don't take too long.
- Come on. When have I ever let you down?

517
00:51:55,363 --> 00:52:00,534
Very well. The burden is on me not to
destroy all the droids until you arrive.

518
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:27,728
Save your energy.

519
00:52:28,396 --> 00:52:30,188
I can't.

520
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:32,065
Don't give up, Padmé.

521
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,414
Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

522
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,167
He came by this morning.

523
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:53,462
What did he want?

524
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:55,505
He's worried about you.

525
00:52:57,967 --> 00:53:00,260
He says you've been under a lot of stress.

526
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:04,806
I feel lost.

527
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:09,102
Lost? What do you mean?

528
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,398
Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me.

529
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:16,902
They trust you with their lives.

530
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:20,113
Something's happening.

531
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,450
I'm not the Jedi I should be.

532
00:53:25,787 --> 00:53:27,746
I want more.

533
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,874
And I know I shouldn't.

534
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,961
You expect too much of yourself.

535
00:53:38,925 --> 00:53:42,135
- I found a way to save you.
- Save me?

536
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:44,179
From my nightmares.

537
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:46,223
Is that what's bothering you?

538
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:49,184
I won't lose you, Padmé.

539
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,104
I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani.

540
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:54,648
- I promise you.
- No, I promise you.

541
00:54:38,568 --> 00:54:40,986
Greetings, young Jedi.

542
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:44,531
What brings you to our remote sanctuary?

543
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,575
Unfortunately, the war.

544
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:51,246
There's no war here...
unless you brought it with you.

545
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,541
With your kind permission,
I should like some fuel...

546
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:59,588
and to use your city as a base as I search
nearby systems for General Grievous.

547
00:55:08,556 --> 00:55:11,850
He is here. We are being held hostage.

548
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:14,853
- They are watching us.
- I understand.

549
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:19,774
Tenth level, thousands of battle droids.

550
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:22,319
Tell your people to take shelter.

551
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:25,405
If you have warriors, now is the time.

552
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:40,545
Take the fighter back to the ship.
Tell Cody I've made contact.

553
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:46,593
- Is he bringing additional warriors?
- He didn't say.

554
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:34,140
It won't be long before the armies
of the Republic track us here.

555
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:41,982
I am sending you to the Mustafar system
in the outer rim.

556
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:51,783
It is a volcanic planet.

557
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:55,203
- You will be safe there.
- Safe?

558
00:56:55,997 --> 00:56:59,291
Chancellor Palpatine managed
to escape your grip, General.

559
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:03,837
Without Count Dooku, I have doubts
about your ability to keep us safe.

560
00:57:04,714 --> 00:57:09,884
Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not
found yourself in my grip.

561
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:16,016
Your ship is waiting.

562
00:57:33,868 --> 00:57:35,160
Hello there.

563
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,539
General Kenobi.

564
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,045
You are a bold one.

565
00:57:47,048 --> 00:57:48,548
Kill him.

566
00:58:04,357 --> 00:58:05,815
Back away.

567
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:10,528
I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.

568
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:12,113
Your move.

569
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:14,657
You fool.

570
00:58:14,742 --> 00:58:20,580
I've been trained in your
Jedi arts by Count Dooku.

571
00:58:27,088 --> 00:58:29,589
Attack, Kenobi.

572
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:29,232
Go, go, go! Move it! Move it!

573
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:31,234
Everybody out.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

574
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:32,819
Cover yourself. Come on.

575
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:40,160
Move it! Move it!

576
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:44,831
Come on, move! Come on, everybody!

577
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:48,251
Army or not...

578
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:53,465
you must realize you are doomed.

579
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:55,550
I don't think so.

580
01:00:53,943 --> 01:00:55,735
Cover that corner.

581
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:03,826
Master Windu, may I interrupt?

582
01:01:03,911 --> 01:01:06,704
General Kenobi has made contact
with General Grievous...

583
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:09,082
and we have begun our attack.

584
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,917
Thank you, Commander.

585
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:15,129
Anakin, deliver this
report to the chancellor.

586
01:01:15,214 --> 01:01:17,507
His reaction will give us
a clue to his intentions.

587
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:19,092
Yes, Master.

588
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:29,018
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.

589
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:32,397
The dark side of the Force
surrounds the chancellor.

590
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:35,316
If he does not give up
his emergency powers...

591
01:01:35,401 --> 01:01:37,318
after the destruction of Grievous...

592
01:01:37,403 --> 01:01:39,654
then he should be removed from office.

593
01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:43,658
The Jedi Council would have to
take control of the senate...

594
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:45,660
in order to secure a peaceful transition.

595
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:50,248
To a dark place this line
of thought will carry us.

596
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:55,211
Great care we must take.

597
01:02:02,011 --> 01:02:03,511
Chancellor.

598
01:02:04,263 --> 01:02:06,806
We've just received a report
from Master Kenobi.

599
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,559
He has engaged General Grievous.

600
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:13,021
We can only hope that Master Kenobi
is up to the challenge.

601
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:16,858
I should be there with him.

602
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:19,319
It's upsetting to me
to see that the council...

603
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:21,487
doesn't seem to fully
appreciate your talents.

604
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:26,909
Don't you wonder why
they won't make you a Jedi master?

605
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:30,580
I wish I knew.

606
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:34,417
More and more I get the feeling that...

607
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:36,753
I'm being excluded from the council.

608
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:47,680
I know there are things about the Force
that they're not telling me.

609
01:02:49,892 --> 01:02:52,352
They don't trust you, Anakin.

610
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:55,104
They see your future.

611
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:59,108
They know your power
will be too strong to control.

612
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:05,323
You must break through the fog of lies
the Jedi have created around you.

613
01:03:07,326 --> 01:03:11,496
Let me help you to know
the subtleties of the Force.

614
01:03:12,206 --> 01:03:14,374
How do you know the ways of the Force?

615
01:03:15,376 --> 01:03:18,461
My mentor taught me
everything about the Force.

616
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:22,215
Even the nature of the dark side.

617
01:03:24,176 --> 01:03:26,552
You know the dark side?

618
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:32,475
If one is to understand
the great mystery...

619
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,977
one must study all its aspects...

620
01:03:35,062 --> 01:03:38,231
not just the dogmatic
narrow view of the Jedi.

621
01:03:38,941 --> 01:03:42,110
If you wish to become
a complete and wise leader...

622
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:45,905
you must embrace a larger
view of the Force.

623
01:03:46,615 --> 01:03:48,658
Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.

624
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:54,872
Only through me can you achieve
a power greater than any Jedi.

625
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:58,251
Learn to know the dark side of the Force...

626
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:02,004
and you will be able to save your wife...

627
01:04:02,089 --> 01:04:04,173
from certain death.

628
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:07,176
What did you say?

629
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:10,930
Use my knowledge. I beg you.

630
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,809
You're the Sith lord.

631
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:18,771
I know what's been troubling you.
Listen to me.

632
01:04:19,732 --> 01:04:23,443
Don't continue to be a pawn
of the Jedi Council.

633
01:04:25,571 --> 01:04:29,031
Ever since I've known you,
you've been searching for a life...

634
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:31,701
greater than that of an ordinary Jedi.

635
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:34,203
A life of significance...

636
01:04:34,288 --> 01:04:35,788
of conscience.

637
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:45,089
- Are you going to kill me?
- I would certainly like to.

638
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:48,551
I know you would.

639
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:52,472
I can feel your anger.

640
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:55,266
It gives you focus...

641
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,727
makes you stronger.

642
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:06,360
I'm going to turn you over
to the Jedi Council.

643
01:05:06,445 --> 01:05:08,112
Of course. You should.

644
01:05:08,197 --> 01:05:11,240
But you're not sure
of their intentions, are you?

645
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:13,868
I will quickly discover
the truth of all this.

646
01:05:14,995 --> 01:05:17,413
You have great wisdom, Anakin.

647
01:05:17,498 --> 01:05:21,167
Know the power of the dark side.

648
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:24,045
Power to save Padmé.

649
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:33,758
So uncivilized.

650
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:43,267
Master Windu, I must talk to you.

651
01:07:43,352 --> 01:07:47,188
Skywalker, we just received word that
Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.

652
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:49,190
We're on our way to make sure...

653
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:51,567
the chancellor returns
emergency power back to the senate.

654
01:07:51,652 --> 01:07:55,321
He won't give up his power.
I've just learned a terrible truth.

655
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:57,573
I think Chancellor
Palpatine is a Sith lord.

656
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,576
A Sith lord?

657
01:08:00,661 --> 01:08:03,537
Yes. The one we've been looking for.

658
01:08:03,622 --> 01:08:06,666
- How do you know this?
- He knows the ways of the Force.

659
01:08:07,668 --> 01:08:09,835
He's been trained to use the dark side.

660
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,755
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

661
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:16,425
Then our worst fears have been realized.

662
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:20,012
We must move quickly
if the Jedi order is to survive.

663
01:08:20,097 --> 01:08:22,556
Master, the chancellor is very powerful.

664
01:08:22,641 --> 01:08:24,934
You'll need my help
if you're going to arrest him.

665
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:27,979
For you own good, stay out of this affair.

666
01:08:28,063 --> 01:08:30,856
I sense a great deal of confusion
in you, young Skywalker.

667
01:08:30,941 --> 01:08:33,109
There is much fear that
clouds your judgment.

668
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:35,194
- I must go, Master.
- No.

669
01:08:37,364 --> 01:08:41,367
If what you've told me is true,
you will have gained my trust.

670
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,036
But for now, remain here.

671
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:48,040
Wait in the council
chambers until we return.

672
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:51,585
Yes, Master.

673
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:23,951
You do know, don't you...

674
01:09:24,036 --> 01:09:26,412
if the Jedi destroy me...

675
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:30,499
any chance of saving her will be lost.

676
01:10:59,381 --> 01:11:03,843
Master Windu. I take it General Grievous
has been destroyed then.

677
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:07,221
I must say you're here
sooner than expected.

678
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:10,933
In the name of
the Galactic Senate of the Republic...

679
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:12,977
you're under arrest, Chancellor.

680
01:11:13,061 --> 01:11:15,688
Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?

681
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,731
The senate will decide your fate.

682
01:11:17,816 --> 01:11:21,694
- I am the senate.
- Not yet.

683
01:11:26,992 --> 01:11:29,368
It's treason then.

684
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:11,887
You are under arrest, my lord.

685
01:13:12,973 --> 01:13:17,309
Anakin, I told you it would
come to this. I was right.

686
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:19,561
The Jedi are taking over.

687
01:13:19,646 --> 01:13:22,147
The oppression of the
Sith will never return.

688
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:24,483
You have lost.

689
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:30,281
You will die!

690
01:13:32,993 --> 01:13:34,910
He's a traitor!

691
01:13:34,995 --> 01:13:37,204
He is the traitor!

692
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:44,545
I have the power to save the one you love.

693
01:13:45,505 --> 01:13:47,464
You must choose.

694
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:51,135
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

695
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:54,847
Don't let him kill me.

696
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:00,686
I can't hold it any longer.

697
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:04,106
I can't. I'm weak.

698
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,191
I'm too weak.

699
01:14:06,276 --> 01:14:07,735
Anakin!

700
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:10,321
Help me. Help me!

701
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:16,994
I can't hold on any longer.

702
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:20,706
I am going to end this once and for all.

703
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,291
You can't.

704
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,376
He must stand trial.

705
01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:27,838
He has control of the
senate and the courts.

706
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:30,174
He's too dangerous to be left alive.

707
01:14:30,258 --> 01:14:32,551
I'm too weak.

708
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:36,263
- Don't kill me. Please.
- It's not the Jedi way.

709
01:14:36,348 --> 01:14:37,890
He must live.

710
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:43,562
- Please don't.
- I need him.

711
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:45,689
Please don't!

712
01:14:53,073 --> 01:14:54,740
Power!

713
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:05,959
Unlimited power!

714
01:15:17,055 --> 01:15:19,098
What have I done?

715
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:31,360
You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin.

716
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:35,280
Become my apprentice.

717
01:15:35,365 --> 01:15:40,828
Learn to use the dark side of the Force.

718
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:46,458
I will do whatever you ask.

719
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:51,088
Good.

720
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:55,384
Just help me save Padmé's life.

721
01:15:57,303 --> 01:15:59,721
I can't live without her.

722
01:16:02,851 --> 01:16:08,272
To cheat death is a power
only one has achieved...

723
01:16:08,356 --> 01:16:11,358
but if we work together...

724
01:16:11,443 --> 01:16:15,487
I know we can discover the secret.

725
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:18,949
I pledge myself...

726
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:22,536
to your teachings.

727
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,205
Good.

728
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:28,500
Good.

729
01:16:36,718 --> 01:16:41,180
The Force is strong with you.

730
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:46,852
A powerful Sith you will become.

731
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:51,231
Henceforth you shall be known as...

732
01:16:51,316 --> 01:16:55,235
Darth... Vader.

733
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:03,202
Thank you, my master.

734
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:06,872
Rise.

735
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:25,474
Because the council did not trust you,
my young apprentice...

736
01:17:27,018 --> 01:17:31,813
I believe you are the only Jedi
with no knowledge of this plot.

737
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:35,859
When the Jedi learn
what has transpired here...

738
01:17:35,944 --> 01:17:39,905
they will kill us,
along with all the senators.

739
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,157
I agree.

740
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:46,745
The council's next move
will be against the senate.

741
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:49,540
Every single Jedi...

742
01:17:49,624 --> 01:17:52,918
including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi...

743
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:56,588
is now an enemy of the Republic.

744
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:59,591
I understand, Master.

745
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:02,302
We must move quickly.

746
01:18:02,387 --> 01:18:04,346
The Jedi are relentless.

747
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:10,269
If they are not all destroyed,
it will be civil war without end.

748
01:18:11,938 --> 01:18:15,774
First I want you to go to the Jedi temple.

749
01:18:16,818 --> 01:18:19,903
We will catch them off-balance.

750
01:18:19,988 --> 01:18:23,991
Do what must be done, Lord Vader.

751
01:18:24,075 --> 01:18:27,494
Do not hesitate. Show no mercy.

752
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:32,958
Only then will you be strong enough
with the dark side...

753
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:35,085
to save Padmé.

754
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:40,048
What about the other Jedi
spread across the galaxy?

755
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:43,260
Their betrayal will be dealt with.

756
01:18:45,138 --> 01:18:48,432
After you have killed
all the Jedi in the temple...

757
01:18:48,516 --> 01:18:51,226
go to the Mustafar system.

758
01:18:51,311 --> 01:18:54,605
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...

759
01:18:54,689 --> 01:18:58,150
and the other separatist leaders.

760
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:04,156
Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy!

761
01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:07,117
And...

762
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:12,331
we shall have... peace.

763
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,417
Sergeant, over here!

764
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:00,379
Hurry! All of them!

765
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:05,050
All Red units, let's move it!

766
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,052
Come on. Let's go!

767
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,943
Commander, contact your troops.

768
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:24,986
Tell them to move to the higher levels.

769
01:20:25,071 --> 01:20:26,988
Very good, sir.

770
01:20:27,073 --> 01:20:29,241
By the way, I think you'll be needing this.

771
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:33,620
Thank you, Cody. Let's get a move on.
We've got a battle to win.

772
01:20:33,705 --> 01:20:34,913
Yes, sir.

773
01:20:41,671 --> 01:20:43,171
Commander Cody...

774
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,175
the time has come.

775
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:51,555
Execute order 66.

776
01:20:52,265 --> 01:20:54,224
Yes, my lord.

777
01:20:58,062 --> 01:20:59,438
Blast him!

778
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:27,799
Come on!

779
01:22:18,184 --> 01:22:21,520
Execute order 66.

780
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,147
It will be done, my lord.

781
01:23:06,941 --> 01:23:08,942
It will be done, my lord.

782
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:48,189
Master Skywalker, there
are too many of them.

783
01:23:48,274 --> 01:23:50,275
What are we going to do?

784
01:24:00,745 --> 01:24:04,915
The chancellor's office indicated Master
Anakin returned to the Jedi temple.

785
01:24:04,999 --> 01:24:08,126
Don't worry. I'm sure he'll be all right.

786
01:24:37,323 --> 01:24:40,408
- What's going on here?
- There's been a rebellion, sir.

787
01:24:40,493 --> 01:24:43,119
Don't worry.
The situation is under control.

788
01:24:43,871 --> 01:24:46,456
I'm sorry, sir. It's time for you to leave.

789
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:50,168
And so it is.

790
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:55,757
Get him!

791
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:15,193
Don't worry about him. Let him go.

792
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:45,015
All these Wookiees are dead.
Move to the east.

793
01:25:45,099 --> 01:25:46,599
Yes, sir.

794
01:25:54,692 --> 01:25:56,609
Good-bye, Tarfful.

795
01:25:56,694 --> 01:25:58,695
Good-bye, Chewbacca.

796
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,408
Miss you I will.

797
01:26:40,404 --> 01:26:42,781
Hopefully we'll be able to
intercept a few Jedi...

798
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:45,200
before they walk into this catastrophe.

799
01:26:50,915 --> 01:26:52,874
Did you find Kenobi?

800
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:54,918
Sir, no one could have survived that fall.

801
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,296
Start loading your men on the ships.

802
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:59,881
Move it.

803
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:35,208
Emergency code 913.

804
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:37,210
I have no contact on any frequency.

805
01:27:39,922 --> 01:27:41,381
Master Kenobi.

806
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:43,466
- Repeat.
- Master Kenobi.

807
01:27:43,551 --> 01:27:47,512
Senator Organa. My clone troops
turned on me. I need help.

808
01:27:48,472 --> 01:27:50,390
We have just rescued Master Yoda.

809
01:27:50,474 --> 01:27:52,600
It appears this ambush
has happened everywhere.

810
01:27:52,685 --> 01:27:54,853
We're sending you our coordinates.

811
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:04,487
Hush! Not so loud.

812
01:28:04,572 --> 01:28:07,615
Are you all right? I heard there was
an attack on the Jedi temple.

813
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:10,118
- You could see the smoke from here.
- I'm fine.

814
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:12,120
I came to see if you and the baby are safe.

815
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:13,872
What's happening?

816
01:28:14,707 --> 01:28:16,833
The Jedi have tried to
overthrow the Republic.

817
01:28:17,543 --> 01:28:19,460
I can't believe that.

818
01:28:19,545 --> 01:28:23,131
I saw Master Windu attempt to
assassinate the chancellor myself.

819
01:28:25,885 --> 01:28:27,719
What are you gonna do?

820
01:28:36,395 --> 01:28:38,605
I will not betray the Republic.

821
01:28:40,566 --> 01:28:42,525
My loyalties lie with the chancellor...

822
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:46,404
and with the senate and with you.

823
01:28:47,156 --> 01:28:50,408
- What about Obi-Wan?
- I don't know.

824
01:28:51,118 --> 01:28:53,244
Many Jedi have been killed.

825
01:28:53,329 --> 01:28:56,206
We can only hope that
he's remained loyal to the chancellor.

826
01:28:57,249 --> 01:28:59,626
Anakin, I'm afraid.

827
01:29:02,588 --> 01:29:04,672
Have faith, my love.

828
01:29:04,757 --> 01:29:07,091
Everything will soon be set right.

829
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:10,970
The chancellor has given me
a very important mission.

830
01:29:11,055 --> 01:29:13,932
The separatists have gathered
on the Mustafar system.

831
01:29:14,642 --> 01:29:18,519
I'm going there to end this war.
Wait for me until I return.

832
01:29:18,604 --> 01:29:21,022
Things will be different. I promise.

833
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:28,821
Please, wait for me.

834
01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:35,620
Well, he is under a lot of stress, R2.

835
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:39,791
Take care, my little friend.

836
01:29:44,046 --> 01:29:47,757
Oh, my lady, is there anything I might do?

837
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:50,426
No, thank you, 3PO.

838
01:29:52,763 --> 01:29:55,223
I feel so helpless.

839
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:21,416
How many other Jedi have managed to survive?

840
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:24,085
Heard from no one have we.

841
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:28,047
I saw thousands of troops
attack the Jedi temple.

842
01:30:28,132 --> 01:30:30,049
That's why I went looking for Yoda.

843
01:30:30,134 --> 01:30:32,593
Have we had any contact from the temple?

844
01:30:32,678 --> 01:30:35,680
Received a coded retreat message we have.

845
01:30:36,515 --> 01:30:39,809
It requests all Jedi to
return to the temple.

846
01:30:39,893 --> 01:30:43,354
- It says the war is over.
- Then we must go back.

847
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:46,983
If there are any stragglers, they will
fall into the trap and be killed.

848
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:51,904
Suggest dismantling the
coded signal, do you?

849
01:30:51,989 --> 01:30:54,741
Yes, Master. There is too much at stake.

850
01:30:55,826 --> 01:30:57,410
I agree.

851
01:30:57,494 --> 01:31:01,122
And a little more knowledge
might light our way.

852
01:31:22,061 --> 01:31:25,521
The plan has gone
as you had promised, my lord.

853
01:31:25,606 --> 01:31:28,399
You have done well, Viceroy.

854
01:31:28,484 --> 01:31:34,322
When my new apprentice
Darth Vader arrives...

855
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:37,950
he will take care of you.

856
01:31:50,297 --> 01:31:52,715
We're receiving a message from
the chancellor's office, sir.

857
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,759
- Send it through.
- Yes, sir.

858
01:31:56,470 --> 01:32:01,182
Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor
requests your presence...

859
01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:03,267
at a special session of Congress.

860
01:32:03,352 --> 01:32:06,938
- I will be there.
- He'll be expecting you.

861
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:13,194
- Could be a trap.
- I don't think so.

862
01:32:13,278 --> 01:32:16,406
The chancellor will not be able to
control the thousands of star systems...

863
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:18,449
without keeping the senate intact.

864
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:22,578
If a special session of
Congress there is...

865
01:32:22,663 --> 01:32:25,998
easier for us to enter
the Jedi temple it will be.

866
01:33:04,455 --> 01:33:06,456
R2, stay with the ship.

867
01:33:31,857 --> 01:33:34,901
Welcome, Lord Vader.
We've been expecting you.

868
01:34:06,725 --> 01:34:11,270
And the Jedi rebellion has been foiled.

869
01:34:11,355 --> 01:34:12,438
What's happened?

870
01:34:12,523 --> 01:34:17,068
The chancellor's been elaborating on a
plot by the Jedi to overthrow the senate.

871
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:22,657
The remaining Jedi will be
hunted down and defeated.

872
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:40,925
Not even the younglings survived.

873
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:47,390
Killed not by clones this Padawan.

874
01:34:48,392 --> 01:34:51,060
By a lightsaber he was.

875
01:34:57,901 --> 01:34:59,485
Who?

876
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:01,487
Who could have done this?

877
01:35:12,165 --> 01:35:15,376
The attempt on my life...

878
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:20,381
has left me scarred and deformed.

879
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:24,218
But I assure you.

880
01:35:24,303 --> 01:35:29,056
My resolve has never been stronger!

881
01:35:33,228 --> 01:35:34,478
Stop!

882
01:35:47,409 --> 01:35:53,080
In order to ensure the security
and continuing stability...

883
01:35:53,165 --> 01:35:57,084
the Republic will be reorganized...

884
01:35:57,169 --> 01:36:02,673
into the first Galactic Empire!

885
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:09,430
For a safe and secure society.

886
01:36:18,815 --> 01:36:20,900
So this is how liberty dies.

887
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:24,362
With thunderous applause.

888
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:28,949
The war is over.

889
01:36:29,034 --> 01:36:33,204
Lord Sidious promised us peace.
We only want...

890
01:36:41,296 --> 01:36:46,008
I have recalibrated the code,
warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

891
01:36:46,093 --> 01:36:48,552
For the clones...

892
01:36:48,637 --> 01:36:52,765
to discover the recalibration
a long time it will take.

893
01:37:05,070 --> 01:37:06,570
Wait. Master.

894
01:37:08,073 --> 01:37:10,449
There is something I must know.

895
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:21,001
If into the security recordings you go,
only pain will you find.

896
01:37:21,086 --> 01:37:23,671
I must know the truth, Master.

897
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:33,389
It can't be.

898
01:37:33,473 --> 01:37:35,391
It can't be.

899
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:39,562
You have done well, my new apprentice.

900
01:37:39,646 --> 01:37:42,690
Now, Lord Vader...

901
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:46,318
go and bring peace to the Empire.

902
01:37:46,403 --> 01:37:48,612
I can't watch any more.

903
01:37:49,322 --> 01:37:53,284
Destroy the Sith we must.

904
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:57,163
Send me to kill the emperor.

905
01:37:57,247 --> 01:37:59,540
I will not kill Anakin.

906
01:37:59,624 --> 01:38:04,378
To fight this Lord Sidious,
strong enough you are not.

907
01:38:04,463 --> 01:38:07,757
He is like my brother. I cannot do it.

908
01:38:08,467 --> 01:38:13,554
Twisted by the dark side
young Skywalker has become.

909
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:17,057
The boy you trained, gone he is.

910
01:38:17,142 --> 01:38:20,060
Consumed by Darth Vader.

911
01:38:20,145 --> 01:38:23,189
I do not know where the
emperor has sent him.

912
01:38:23,273 --> 01:38:25,524
I don't know where to look.

913
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:30,529
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan,
and find him you will.

914
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:43,083
When was the last time you saw him?

915
01:38:43,752 --> 01:38:47,171
- Yesterday.
- And do you know where he is now?

916
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:53,677
Padmé, I need your help.

917
01:38:54,346 --> 01:38:57,014
- He is in grave danger.
- From the Sith?

918
01:38:57,766 --> 01:38:59,266
From himself.

919
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:06,106
Anakin has turned to the dark side.

920
01:39:06,191 --> 01:39:09,693
You're wrong. How could you even say that?

921
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:17,493
I have seen a security hologram...
of him...

922
01:39:19,079 --> 01:39:20,830
killing younglings.

923
01:39:20,914 --> 01:39:23,999
Not Anakin. He couldn't.

924
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:27,044
He was deceived by a lie. We all were.

925
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:31,674
It appears that the chancellor
is behind everything, including the war.

926
01:39:33,468 --> 01:39:36,220
Palpatine is the Sith lord
we've been looking for.

927
01:39:36,304 --> 01:39:40,432
After the death of Count Dooku,
Anakin became his new apprentice.

928
01:39:46,606 --> 01:39:48,607
I don't believe you.

929
01:39:49,985 --> 01:39:51,485
I can't.

930
01:39:59,661 --> 01:40:01,954
I must find him.

931
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:06,417
You're going to kill him, aren't you?

932
01:40:10,088 --> 01:40:12,590
He has become a very great threat.

933
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:16,677
I can't.

934
01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:32,318
Anakin is the father, isn't he?

935
01:40:36,698 --> 01:40:38,699
I'm so sorry.

936
01:41:24,496 --> 01:41:26,747
- Milady, let me come with you.
- There's no danger.

937
01:41:26,831 --> 01:41:29,041
The fighting's over. And this is personal.

938
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:31,543
As you wish, milady, but
I strongly disagree.

939
01:41:31,628 --> 01:41:35,297
I'll be all right, Captain.
This is something I must do myself.

940
01:41:35,382 --> 01:41:37,800
Besides, 3PO will look after me.

941
01:41:40,011 --> 01:41:41,512
Oh, dear.

942
01:41:53,441 --> 01:41:57,111
Do you know? I think I'm beginning to
get the hang of this flying business.

943
01:42:25,432 --> 01:42:28,892
The separatists have been
taken care of, my master.

944
01:42:28,977 --> 01:42:31,895
It is finished then.

945
01:42:33,273 --> 01:42:39,111
You have restored peace
and justice to the galaxy.

946
01:42:39,863 --> 01:42:44,116
Send a message to the ships
of the Trade Federation.

947
01:42:44,909 --> 01:42:49,413
All droid units must shut down immediately.

948
01:42:50,248 --> 01:42:52,249
Very good, my lord.

949
01:43:51,476 --> 01:43:53,602
I saw your ship.

950
01:43:56,397 --> 01:43:59,441
- What are you doing out here?
- I was so worried about you.

951
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:03,737
Obi-Wan told me terrible things.

952
01:44:03,822 --> 01:44:05,405
What things?

953
01:44:06,074 --> 01:44:09,034
He said you've turned to the dark side.

954
01:44:09,119 --> 01:44:13,789
That you... killed younglings.

955
01:44:15,291 --> 01:44:18,001
Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.

956
01:44:18,086 --> 01:44:20,003
He cares about us.

957
01:44:20,672 --> 01:44:21,880
Us?

958
01:44:21,965 --> 01:44:23,465
He knows.

959
01:44:24,801 --> 01:44:26,718
He wants to help you.

960
01:44:30,515 --> 01:44:33,809
Anakin, all I want is your love.

961
01:44:33,893 --> 01:44:36,270
Love won't save you, Padmé.

962
01:44:36,354 --> 01:44:39,606
- Only my new powers can do that.
- At what cost?

963
01:44:39,691 --> 01:44:42,109
You're a good person. Don't do this.

964
01:44:42,193 --> 01:44:44,945
I won't lose you the way I lost my mother.

965
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:49,283
I am becoming more powerful
than any Jedi has ever dreamed of.

966
01:44:49,367 --> 01:44:52,202
And I'm doing it for you. To protect you.

967
01:44:53,496 --> 01:44:55,497
Come away with me.

968
01:44:56,207 --> 01:44:58,250
Help me raise our child.

969
01:44:58,334 --> 01:45:01,170
Leave everything else behind
while we still can.

970
01:45:01,254 --> 01:45:05,215
Don't you see?
We don't have to run away anymore.

971
01:45:06,009 --> 01:45:08,552
I have brought peace to the Republic.

972
01:45:09,554 --> 01:45:11,513
I am more powerful than the chancellor.

973
01:45:11,598 --> 01:45:13,724
I can overthrow him.

974
01:45:15,768 --> 01:45:18,854
And together, you and I
can rule the galaxy...

975
01:45:18,938 --> 01:45:21,398
make things the way we want them to be.

976
01:45:27,697 --> 01:45:29,740
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

977
01:45:31,201 --> 01:45:34,536
Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.

978
01:45:36,706 --> 01:45:39,583
I don't want to hear any
more about Obi-Wan.

979
01:45:40,418 --> 01:45:43,879
The Jedi turned against me.
Don't you turn against me.

980
01:45:45,548 --> 01:45:47,591
I don't know you anymore.

981
01:45:51,262 --> 01:45:53,263
You're breaking my heart.

982
01:45:53,932 --> 01:45:56,934
You're going down a path I can't follow.

983
01:45:57,894 --> 01:45:59,811
Because of Obi-Wan?

984
01:46:00,563 --> 01:46:02,689
Because of what you've done.

985
01:46:02,774 --> 01:46:04,733
What you plan to do.

986
01:46:05,944 --> 01:46:08,612
Stop. Stop now. Come back.

987
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:11,657
- I love you.
- Liar!

988
01:46:16,454 --> 01:46:20,249
You're with him!
You brought him here to kill me.

989
01:46:21,668 --> 01:46:23,293
Let her go, Anakin.

990
01:46:26,464 --> 01:46:28,674
Let her go.

991
01:46:38,643 --> 01:46:40,686
You turned her against me!

992
01:46:42,272 --> 01:46:44,481
You have done that yourself.

993
01:46:49,195 --> 01:46:51,405
You will not take her from me!

994
01:46:51,489 --> 01:46:55,367
Your anger and your lust for power
have already done that.

995
01:46:59,289 --> 01:47:03,667
You have allowed this dark lord
to twist your mind...

996
01:47:05,211 --> 01:47:08,422
until now you have become
the very thing you swore to destroy.

997
01:47:08,506 --> 01:47:10,424
Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.

998
01:47:10,508 --> 01:47:13,051
I see through the lies of the Jedi.

999
01:47:14,137 --> 01:47:16,555
I do not fear the dark side as you do.

1000
01:47:18,349 --> 01:47:20,309
I have brought peace...

1001
01:47:20,393 --> 01:47:25,188
freedom, justice and security
to my new empire.

1002
01:47:26,149 --> 01:47:28,317
Your new empire?

1003
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:31,194
Don't make me kill you.

1004
01:47:32,530 --> 01:47:37,075
Anakin, my allegiance is to
the Republic, to democracy!

1005
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:39,911
If you're not with me...

1006
01:47:40,788 --> 01:47:42,706
then you're my enemy.

1007
01:47:44,709 --> 01:47:47,210
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.

1008
01:47:49,714 --> 01:47:51,631
I will do what I must.

1009
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:54,718
You will try.

1010
01:48:26,459 --> 01:48:30,504
I hear a new apprentice you have, Emperor.

1011
01:48:30,588 --> 01:48:35,092
Or should I call you Darth Sidious?

1012
01:48:35,176 --> 01:48:37,803
Master Yoda.

1013
01:48:37,887 --> 01:48:39,596
You survived.

1014
01:48:40,431 --> 01:48:41,848
Surprised?

1015
01:48:42,517 --> 01:48:47,145
Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda.

1016
01:48:47,230 --> 01:48:49,314
Now you will experience...

1017
01:48:49,399 --> 01:48:53,902
the full power of the dark side.

1018
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:41,533
I have waited a long
time for this moment...

1019
01:49:41,617 --> 01:49:46,830
my little green friend.

1020
01:49:57,008 --> 01:50:00,510
At last the Jedi are no more.

1021
01:50:00,595 --> 01:50:04,848
Not if anything to say about it I have.

1022
01:50:10,146 --> 01:50:12,522
At an end your rule is.

1023
01:50:14,358 --> 01:50:16,860
And not short enough it was.

1024
01:50:21,574 --> 01:50:23,825
If so powerful you are...

1025
01:50:25,036 --> 01:50:26,536
why leave?

1026
01:50:27,455 --> 01:50:30,040
You will not stop me.

1027
01:50:30,124 --> 01:50:34,753
Darth Vader will become
more powerful than either of us.

1028
01:50:34,837 --> 01:50:39,216
Faith in your new apprentice
misplaced may be.

1029
01:50:40,510 --> 01:50:44,596
As is your faith
in the dark side of the Force.

1030
01:55:12,198 --> 01:55:14,949
Hurry. Careful timing we will need.

1031
01:55:15,034 --> 01:55:17,869
Activate your homing
beacon when you're ready.

1032
01:55:17,953 --> 01:55:20,330
There's no sign of his body, sir.

1033
01:55:20,414 --> 01:55:24,083
- Then he is not dead.
- Double your search.

1034
01:55:24,168 --> 01:55:26,461
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

1035
01:55:27,505 --> 01:55:31,633
Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle
for immediate takeoff.

1036
01:55:31,717 --> 01:55:36,846
- Yes, Master.
- I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

1037
01:56:45,624 --> 01:56:48,835
Into exile I must go.

1038
01:56:49,503 --> 01:56:51,629
Failed I have.

1039
01:58:31,021 --> 01:58:32,981
I have failed you, Anakin.

1040
01:58:33,065 --> 01:58:34,983
I have failed you.

1041
01:58:35,067 --> 01:58:37,986
I should have known the Jedi
were plotting to take over.

1042
01:58:38,070 --> 01:58:40,905
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!

1043
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:43,658
From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.

1044
01:58:43,742 --> 01:58:45,368
Then you are lost!

1045
01:58:57,214 --> 01:58:59,757
This is the end for you, my master.

1046
01:59:24,241 --> 01:59:27,410
It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.

1047
01:59:30,039 --> 01:59:32,749
You underestimate my power.

1048
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:35,251
Don't try it.

1049
01:59:58,108 --> 02:00:00,109
You were the chosen one!

1050
02:00:01,570 --> 02:00:04,781
It was said that you would destroy
the Sith, not join them!

1051
02:00:07,409 --> 02:00:11,245
Bring balance to the Force,
not leave it in darkness!

1052
02:00:22,883 --> 02:00:25,259
I hate you!

1053
02:00:32,643 --> 02:00:34,977
You were my brother, Anakin.

1054
02:00:36,980 --> 02:00:39,357
I loved you.

1055
02:01:20,357 --> 02:01:23,317
Master Kenobi. We have Miss Padmé on board.

1056
02:01:23,402 --> 02:01:25,528
Yes. Please, please hurry.

1057
02:01:25,612 --> 02:01:28,489
We should leave this dreadful place.

1058
02:01:44,006 --> 02:01:46,007
Is Anakin all right?

1059
02:02:54,785 --> 02:02:56,786
Your Majesty, this way.

1060
02:02:57,704 --> 02:02:59,622
There he is.

1061
02:02:59,706 --> 02:03:01,916
He's still alive.

1062
02:03:04,878 --> 02:03:07,129
Get a medical capsule immediately.

1063
02:03:07,214 --> 02:03:09,215
Yes, sir. Right away.

1064
02:03:45,168 --> 02:03:47,128
Excuse me, Master Yoda.

1065
02:03:53,010 --> 02:03:55,219
Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.

1066
02:04:12,029 --> 02:04:14,488
We'll take her to the medical center.
Quickly.

1067
02:04:44,770 --> 02:04:47,021
Medically, she's completely healthy.

1068
02:04:47,105 --> 02:04:50,358
For reasons we can't explain,
we are losing her.

1069
02:04:51,693 --> 02:04:54,445
- She's dying?
- We don't know why.

1070
02:04:54,529 --> 02:04:56,614
She has lost the will to live.

1071
02:04:56,698 --> 02:04:59,867
We need to operate quickly
if we are to save the babies.

1072
02:04:59,951 --> 02:05:01,577
Babies?

1073
02:05:01,661 --> 02:05:03,579
She's carrying twins.

1074
02:05:45,705 --> 02:05:47,206
Luke.

1075
02:05:55,382 --> 02:05:56,882
Oh, Luke.

1076
02:06:19,322 --> 02:06:21,699
- It's a girl.
- Leia.

1077
02:07:11,124 --> 02:07:13,042
There's good in him.

1078
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:17,129
I know.

1079
02:07:17,797 --> 02:07:21,425
I know there's... still...

1080
02:07:56,628 --> 02:07:58,128
Lord Vader.

1081
02:07:59,422 --> 02:08:01,590
Can you hear me?

1082
02:08:04,594 --> 02:08:06,095
Yes, Master.

1083
02:08:09,182 --> 02:08:11,100
Where is Padmé?

1084
02:08:12,894 --> 02:08:14,812
Is she safe?

1085
02:08:15,897 --> 02:08:17,940
Is she all right?

1086
02:08:19,609 --> 02:08:24,196
It seems, in your anger, you killed her.

1087
02:08:25,198 --> 02:08:28,117
I? I couldn't have.

1088
02:08:28,201 --> 02:08:31,245
She was alive. I felt it!

1089
02:08:50,974 --> 02:08:53,475
No!

1090
02:09:05,155 --> 02:09:08,824
Hidden, safe the children must be kept.

1091
02:09:10,577 --> 02:09:14,163
We must take them somewhere where
the Sith will not sense their presence.

1092
02:09:16,666 --> 02:09:18,834
Split up they should be.

1093
02:09:19,502 --> 02:09:21,462
My wife and I will take the girl.

1094
02:09:23,006 --> 02:09:25,924
We've always talked of
adopting a baby girl.

1095
02:09:26,009 --> 02:09:28,302
She will be loved with us.

1096
02:09:29,179 --> 02:09:31,180
And what of the boy?

1097
02:09:32,098 --> 02:09:35,643
To Tatooine. To his family send him.

1098
02:09:37,437 --> 02:09:39,897
I will take the child and watch over him.

1099
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:49,031
Until the time is right, disappear we will.

1100
02:09:50,825 --> 02:09:54,453
Master Kenobi, wait a moment.

1101
02:09:55,955 --> 02:10:01,210
In your solitude on Tatooine,
training I have for you.

1102
02:10:02,504 --> 02:10:03,837
Training?

1103
02:10:03,922 --> 02:10:08,550
An old friend has learned
the path to immortality.

1104
02:10:10,553 --> 02:10:13,681
One who has returned from
the netherworld of the Force.

1105
02:10:13,765 --> 02:10:16,225
Your old master.

1106
02:10:16,893 --> 02:10:18,394
Qui-Gon?

1107
02:10:20,897 --> 02:10:24,191
How to commune with him I will teach you.

1108
02:10:25,652 --> 02:10:27,820
- Captain Antilles.
- Yes, Your Highness?

1109
02:10:27,904 --> 02:10:29,822
I'm placing these droids in your care.

1110
02:10:29,906 --> 02:10:31,824
Treat them well. Clean them up.

1111
02:10:31,908 --> 02:10:33,826
Have the protocol droid's mind wiped.

1112
02:10:33,910 --> 02:10:35,411
What?

1113
02:10:37,247 --> 02:10:39,248
Oh, no!

1114
02:20:02,645 --> 02:20:03,645
English - US

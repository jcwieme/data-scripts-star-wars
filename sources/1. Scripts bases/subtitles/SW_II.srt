1
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,347
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

2
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:21,599
Very good, Lieutenant.

3
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,153
We made it.

4
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,325
I guess I was wrong.

5
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,660
There was no danger at all.

6
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:43,139
Cordé.

7
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:47,477
Milady, I'm so sorry.

8
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,438
I've failed you, Senator.

9
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:51,689
No.

10
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:57,362
Milady, you're still in danger here.

11
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:07,288
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.

12
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:11,042
You did your duty.
Cordé did hers. Now, come.

13
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,004
Senator Amidala, please.

14
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:29,686
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.

15
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,314
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.

16
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,275
If they do break away...

17
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:38,611
I will not let this Republic
that has stood for a thousand years...

18
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:40,780
be split in two.

19
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:44,117
My negotiations will not fail.

20
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,578
If they do, you must realize...

21
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,746
there aren't enough Jedi
to protect the Republic.

22
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:52,375
We're keepers of the peace, not soldiers.

23
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:55,545
Master Yoda...

24
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,215
do you think it will really come to war?

25
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:04,971
The dark side clouds everything.

26
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:10,059
Impossible to see the future is.

27
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:15,148
The Loyalist Committee
has arrived, Your Honor.

28
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,232
Good.

29
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,904
Send them in.

30
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,907
We will discuss this matter later.

31
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:31,956
Senator Amidala, your tragedy
on the landing platform...

32
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,125
terrible.

33
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,837
Seeing you alive brings
warm feelings to my heart.

34
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:40,673
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

35
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:45,428
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

36
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,348
I think that Count Dooku was behind it.

37
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:52,352
He is a political idealist, not a murderer.

38
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:55,480
You know, milady, Count
Dooku was once a Jedi.

39
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:59,025
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.

40
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,694
But for certain, Senator...

41
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:05,657
in grave danger you are.

42
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:09,702
Master Jedi, may I suggest...

43
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:13,915
the senator be placed under
the protection of your graces?

44
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:17,085
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?

45
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,295
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe...

46
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,798
The situation is that serious?

47
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,300
No, but I do, Senator.

48
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:27,762
I realize all too well
that additional security...

49
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:31,349
might be disruptive for you...

50
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,394
but perhaps someone you're familiar with.

51
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,314
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.

52
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,650
That's possible.

53
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,528
He's just returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.

54
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,823
Do it for me, milady. Please?

55
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,325
The thought of losing you...

56
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,162
is unbearable.

57
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:57,166
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

58
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,544
Thank you, Master Windu.

59
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:12,432
- You seem a little on edge.
- Not at all.

60
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:16,185
I haven't felt you this tense since
we fell into that nest of gundarks.

61
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,938
You fell into that nightmare, Master...

62
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:21,816
and I rescued you, remember?

63
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,985
Oh... yes.

64
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:33,494
You're sweating. Relax. Take a deep breath.

65
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,706
I haven't seen her in ten years, Master.

66
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:54,098
Obi? Obi!

67
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:57,852
- Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!
- Good to see you again, Jar Jar.

68
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,937
Senator Padmé.

69
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:03,649
Mesa palos here! Lookie, lookie, Senator.

70
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,527
Desa Jedi arriven.

71
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:13,076
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.

72
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,703
It has been far too long, Master Kenobi.

73
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,456
Ani?

74
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,876
- My goodness, you've grown.
- So have you.

75
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,379
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

76
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,215
Well, for a senator, I mean.

77
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,720
Ani, you'll always be that little boy
I knew on Tatooine.

78
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,725
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.

79
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,311
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

80
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:42,480
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.

81
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,690
I am grateful you are here, Master Kenobi.

82
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:47,568
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.

83
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:50,363
I don't need more security. I need answers.

84
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,698
I want to know who's trying to kill me.

85
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:56,661
We are here to protect you,
Senator, not to start an investigation.

86
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,122
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padmé.

87
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,082
I promise you.

88
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,918
We will not exceed our mandate,
my young Padawan learner.

89
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,963
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master, of course.

90
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,590
We will not go through
this exercise again, Anakin...

91
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,676
and you will pay attention to my lead.

92
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,845
- Why?
- What?

93
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:19,434
Why else do you think we were assigned
to her if not to find the killer?

94
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:22,854
Protection is a job
for local security, not Jedi.

95
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,773
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.

96
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:29,152
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

97
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,657
And you will learn your place, young one.

98
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,204
Perhaps with merely your presence...

99
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:43,207
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

100
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:46,085
Now, if you'll excuse me...

101
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,879
I will retire.

102
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,257
I know I'll feel better having you here.

103
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,009
I'll have an officer stationed
on every floor...

104
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,845
and I'll be in the control
center downstairs.

105
00:09:57,473 --> 00:10:00,475
Mesa busten wit happiness
seein yousa again, Ani.

106
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,728
She hardly even recognized me, Jar Jar.

107
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,316
I've thought about her
every day since we parted...

108
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,611
and she's forgotten me completely.

109
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:15,907
Shesa happy.
Happier den mesa seein her in a longo time.

110
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:19,994
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.

111
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,580
She was pleased to see us.

112
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,665
Now, let's check the security.

113
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,760
I hit the ship, but they used a decoy.

114
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,137
We'll have to try something
more subtle this time, Zam.

115
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:40,223
My client is getting impatient.

116
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,184
Take these. Be careful.
They're very poisonous.

117
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:46,729
And, Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.

118
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,485
Captain Typho has
more than enough men downstairs.

119
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,570
No assassin would try that way.

120
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,698
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.

121
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:02,328
I don't like just waiting here
for something to happen to her.

122
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,706
- What's going on?
- She covered the cameras.

123
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,459
I don't think she liked me watching her.

124
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,461
What is she thinking?

125
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:13,548
She programmed R2 to warn us
if there is an intruder.

126
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:16,259
There are many other
ways to kill a senator.

127
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:20,763
I know, but we also want to catch
this assassin, don't we, Master?

128
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,934
You're using her as bait.

129
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,144
It was her idea.

130
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:29,814
Don't worry. No harm will come to her.

131
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,858
I can sense everything
going on in that room.

132
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,236
Trust me.

133
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,655
It's too risky.

134
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:41,242
Besides, your senses aren't that attuned,
my young apprentice.

135
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,411
And yours are?

136
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:47,456
Possibly.

137
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,806
You look tired.

138
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,475
I don't sleep well anymore.

139
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,145
Because of your mother?

140
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:17,111
I don't know why I keep dreaming about her.

141
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,782
Dreams pass in time.

142
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,870
I'd much rather dream about Padmé.

143
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:30,207
Just being around her again is...
intoxicating.

144
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,752
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.

145
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,212
You've made a commitment
to the Jedi order...

146
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,381
a commitment not easily broken.

147
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:40,217
And don't forget, she's a politician.
They're not to be trusted.

148
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,928
She's not like the others
in the senate, Master.

149
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,222
It is my experience that senators focus...

150
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:48,184
only on pleasing those
who fund their campaigns...

151
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:52,480
and they're in no means scared of
forgetting the niceties of democracy...

152
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,774
- in order to get those funds.
- Not another lecture.

153
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,693
At least not on the economics of politics.

154
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,043
And besides, you're generalizing.

155
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:58,212
The chancellor doesn't
appear to be corrupt.

156
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,964
Palpatine is a politician.

157
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,717
I have observed that he is very clever...

158
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:06,804
in following the passions
and the prejudices of the senators.

159
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,806
I think he's a good man...

160
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,808
I sense it too.

161
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,994
Stay here!

162
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,331
Are you all right, milady?

163
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:09,992
What the...

164
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,336
Jedi poo doo!

165
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,441
- What took you so long?
- Oh, you know, Master.

166
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:27,444
- I couldn't find a speeder I liked...
- There he is.

167
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:30,906
with the open cockpit
and the right speed capabilities.

168
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:33,826
If you spent as long practicing your
saber techniques as you do your wit...

169
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,661
you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.

170
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,454
I thought I already did.

171
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,291
Only in your mind, my
very young apprentice.

172
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:11,238
Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!

173
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,497
You know I don't like it when you do that.

174
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:23,792
Sorry, Master.
I forgot you don't like flying.

175
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,754
I don't mind flying,
but what you're doing is suicide!

176
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,993
Anakin! How many times have I told you...

177
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,287
stay away from power couplings!

178
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,333
That was good!

179
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:22,434
Where are you going? He went that way.

180
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,561
Master, if we keep this chase
going any longer...

181
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,647
that creep is gonna end up deep-fried...

182
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:31,068
and, personally, I'd like to find out
who he is and who he's working for.

183
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,862
This is a shortcut... I think.

184
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,517
Well, you've lost him.

185
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,103
I'm deeply sorry, Master.

186
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,105
That was some shortcut, Anakin.

187
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,607
He went completely the other way.

188
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,776
- Once again you've proved...
- If you'll excuse me.

189
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,906
I hate it when he does that.

190
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,682
Anakin!

191
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:51,643
- She went into the club, Master.
- Patience.

192
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:54,730
- Use the Force. Think.
- Sorry, Master.

193
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:58,108
- He went in there to hide, not to run.
- Yes, Master.

194
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:01,028
- Next time, try not to lose it.
- Yes, Master.

195
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:05,073
- This weapon is your life.
- I try, Master.

196
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,868
Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?

197
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,661
Don't say that, Master.

198
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,830
You're the closest thing
I have to a father.

199
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:13,832
Then why don't you listen to me?

200
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:15,542
I am trying.

201
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:29,556
Can you see him?

202
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:31,642
I think he is a she...

203
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:34,436
and I think she is a changeling.

204
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,648
In that case, be extra careful.

205
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:42,110
- Go and find her.
- Where are you going, Master?

206
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,737
For a drink.

207
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,124
Thank you.

208
00:22:57,293 --> 00:23:00,337
- You wanna buy some death sticks?
- You don't want to sell me death sticks.

209
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,089
I don't want to sell you death sticks.

210
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:03,924
You want to go home and rethink your life.

211
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,301
I want to go home and rethink my life.

212
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,476
Easy.

213
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,729
Jedi business. Go back to your drinks.

214
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:08,030
Do you know who it was
you were trying to kill?

215
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,407
It was a senator from Naboo.

216
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:13,201
- And who hired you?
- It was just a job.

217
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:16,580
Who hired you? Tell us.

218
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,083
Tell us now!

219
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:22,878
It was a bounty hunter called...

220
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:32,679
Wee shahnit... sleemo.

221
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,066
Toxic dart.

222
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:58,538
Track down this bounty hunter
you must, Obi-Wan.

223
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:02,084
Most importantly,
find out who he's working for.

224
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:06,088
What about Senator Amidala?
She will still need protecting.

225
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:09,132
Handle that your Padawan will.

226
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:14,513
Anakin, escort the senator
back to her home planet of Naboo.

227
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:18,350
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.

228
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,435
Travel as refugees.

229
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,480
As the leader of the opposition,
it will be very difficult...

230
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,941
to get Senator Amidala
to leave the capital.

231
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:29,736
Until caught this killer is...

232
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:33,240
our judgment she must respect.

233
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:35,450
Anakin, go to the senate...

234
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:38,787
and ask Chancellor Palpatine
to speak with her about this matter.

235
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,589
I will talk with her.

236
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:52,843
Senator Amidala will not refuse
an executive order.

237
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:55,095
I know her well enough
to assure you of that.

238
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,264
Thank you, Your Excellency.

239
00:25:57,348 --> 00:26:00,767
And so, they've finally
given you an assignment.

240
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:03,854
Your patience has paid off.

241
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:06,314
Your guidance more than my patience.

242
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,818
You don't need guidance, Anakin.

243
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:14,156
In time, you will learn
to trust your feelings.

244
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,160
Then you will be invincible.

245
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:23,206
I have said it many times:

246
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:26,084
You are the most gifted
Jedi I have ever met.

247
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:28,086
Thank you, Your Excellency.

248
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:31,882
I see you becoming the greatest
of all the Jedi, Anakin...

249
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:34,509
even more powerful than Master Yoda.

250
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,725
I am concerned for my Padawan.

251
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:44,561
He is not ready to be given
this assignment on his own yet.

252
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:47,898
The council is confident
in its decision, Obi-Wan.

253
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:49,941
The boy has exceptional skills.

254
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:52,486
But he still has much to learn, Master.

255
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:56,072
His abilities have made
him, well, arrogant.

256
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:58,116
Yes.

257
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:01,203
A flaw more and more common among Jedi.

258
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,665
Too sure of themselves they are.

259
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,211
Even the older, more experienced ones.

260
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:12,923
Remember, Obi-Wan, if
the prophecy is true...

261
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:16,676
your apprentice is the only one who can
bring the Force back into balance.

262
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:23,600
I'm taking an extended leave of absence.

263
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:26,811
It will be your responsibility
to take my place in the senate.

264
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:29,814
Representative Binks,
I know I can count on you.

265
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:34,694
Mesa honored to be taking on
dissa heavy burden.

266
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:39,074
Mesa accept this with muy,
muy humility and...

267
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,785
Jar Jar, I don't wish to hold you up.

268
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,828
I'm sure you have a great deal to do.

269
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:45,956
Of course.

270
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,624
Milady.

271
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:54,089
I do not like this idea of hiding.

272
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:56,299
Don't worry.

273
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:58,635
Now that the council
has ordered an investigation...

274
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:01,388
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long
to find this bounty hunter.

275
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:04,391
I haven't worked for a year
to defeat the Military Creation Act...

276
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,560
to not be here when its fate is decided.

277
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,728
Sometimes we must let go of our pride...

278
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:10,772
and do what is requested of us.

279
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,942
Anakin, you've grown up.

280
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:18,280
Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it.

281
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:29,666
Don't get me wrong.
Obi-Wan is a great mentor.

282
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,335
As wise as Master Yoda and...

283
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,588
as powerful as Master Windu.

284
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,342
I am truly thankful to be his apprentice.

285
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,598
In some ways... a lot of ways...

286
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:48,602
I'm really ahead of him.

287
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:51,146
I'm ready for the trials...

288
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,691
but he feels that I'm too unpredictable.

289
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,693
He won't let me move on.

290
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,863
- That must be frustrating.
- It's worse.

291
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,741
He's overly critical. He never listens.

292
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:05,201
He doesn't understand.

293
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:07,412
It's not fair!

294
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:12,375
All mentors have a way of seeing
more of our faults than we would like.

295
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,502
It's the only way we grow.

296
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:18,006
I know.

297
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,009
Anakin...

298
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:25,847
don't try to grow up too fast.

299
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,016
But I am grown up.

300
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:32,062
You said it yourself.

301
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:35,315
Please don't look at me like that.

302
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,734
Why not?

303
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:40,028
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

304
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,990
Sorry, milady.

305
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:02,008
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.

306
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:05,178
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat's on you two now.

307
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,263
He'll be safe with me.

308
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:13,311
You'll be fine.

309
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:16,648
It's not me, milady. I worry about you.

310
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,067
What if they realize
you've left the capital?

311
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:23,530
Well, then my Jedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.

312
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:25,532
Anakin...

313
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:28,743
don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.

314
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,787
Yes, Master.

315
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:34,499
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.

316
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,501
You'll be back here in no time.

317
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,838
I'll be most grateful
for your speed, Master Jedi.

318
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,840
- It's time to go.
- I know.

319
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:44,509
Anakin, may the Force be with you.

320
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,636
May the Force be with you, Master.

321
00:30:58,107 --> 00:30:59,983
Suddenly I'm afraid.

322
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:03,737
This is my first assignment on my own.
I am too.

323
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:08,283
Don't worry. We have R2 with us.

324
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:16,166
I do hope he doesn't try anything foolish.

325
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:20,420
I'd be more concerned about her
doing something than him.

326
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:44,235
Someone to see ya, honey!

327
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,279
Jedi, by the looks of him.

328
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,948
Obi-Wan!

329
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,284
Hello, Dex.

330
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:53,995
Take a seat. I'll be right with ya.

331
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:59,375
- You wanna cup o' jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

332
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:06,216
Old buddy!

333
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:18,561
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?

334
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,522
You can tell me what this is.

335
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:25,235
Well, whattaya know!

336
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:27,695
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'...

337
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,074
on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim.

338
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,618
Can you tell me where it came from?

339
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:36,663
This baby belongs to them cloners.

340
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:41,084
What you got here is a Kamino saberdart.

341
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:44,170
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.

342
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:47,590
It's these funny little cuts on the side
that give it away.

343
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:51,636
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols.

344
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,972
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect...

345
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:56,432
for the difference between knowledge and...

346
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,269
wisdom.

347
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:01,062
Well, if droids could think...

348
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,064
there'd be none of us here, would there?

349
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:06,484
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?

350
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:08,528
No, no. It's beyond the outer rim.

351
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:14,033
I'd say about 12 parsecs
outside the Rishi Maze.

352
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:18,913
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.

353
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:24,627
These Kaminoans keep to themselves.

354
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:27,589
They're cloners. Damn good ones too.

355
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:32,176
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Depends.

356
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:34,178
Depends on what, Dex?

357
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:37,181
On how good your manners are...

358
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:41,603
and how big your... pocketbook is.

359
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:54,991
- Did you call for assistance?
- Yes, I did.

360
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,243
Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?

361
00:33:57,328 --> 00:34:00,663
Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system
called Kamino.

362
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:03,041
It doesn't show up on the archive charts.

363
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:07,420
Kamino. It's not a system
I'm familiar with.

364
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,881
Are you sure you have
the right coordinates?

365
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:13,009
According to my information, it should
appear in this quadrant here...

366
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,178
just south of the Rishi Maze.

367
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:25,438
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for...

368
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,231
doesn't exist.

369
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:30,860
Impossible.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.

370
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:34,030
If an item does not
appear in our records...

371
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:36,199
it does not exist.

372
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:00,473
Hey, you! No droids!

373
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,517
Get outta here!

374
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:11,192
Thank you, R2.

375
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:14,904
Must be difficult,
having sworn your life to the Jedi...

376
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:18,908
not being able to visit the places
you like or do the things you like.

377
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:21,160
Or be with the people that I love.

378
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,122
Are you allowed to love?

379
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,040
I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.

380
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:31,879
Attachment is forbidden.

381
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:35,591
Possession is forbidden.

382
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:39,262
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love...

383
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,848
is central to a Jedi's life.

384
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:48,646
So you might say that
we are encouraged to love.

385
00:35:48,731 --> 00:35:50,690
You've changed so much.

386
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,359
You haven't changed a bit.

387
00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:56,362
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.

388
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:12,712
Reach out. Sense the Force around you.

389
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,548
Use your feelings you must.

390
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,972
Younglings. Younglings!

391
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:25,475
A visitor we have.

392
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:28,478
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

393
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,021
Hello.

394
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,647
I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.

395
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:34,108
What help can I be, Obi-Wan?

396
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,446
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.

397
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,741
I trust him, but the systems don't show
on the archive maps.

398
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:46,162
Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.

399
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:50,291
How embarrassing. How embarrassing!

400
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,669
Liam, the shades.

401
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:57,507
Gather round the map reader.

402
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:59,550
Clear your minds...

403
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:03,346
and find Obi-Wan's wayward planet we will.

404
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:07,725
It ought to be here...

405
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,727
but it isn't.

406
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:13,272
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.

407
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:16,943
Gravity's silhouette remains...

408
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:20,029
but the star and all the planets...

409
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:22,115
disappeared they have.

410
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,367
How can this be?

411
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:27,203
A thought?

412
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,373
Anyone.

413
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:31,874
Master?

414
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:34,877
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.

415
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:42,135
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.

416
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,223
The Padawan is right.

417
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:50,393
Go to the center of gravity's pull...

418
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:54,021
and find your planet you will.

419
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:02,738
The data must have been erased.

420
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:07,577
But who could empty information from
the archives? Isn't that impossible?

421
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:11,080
Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is.

422
00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:15,585
Only a Jedi could have erased those files.

423
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:19,088
But who and why, harder to answer.

424
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:23,050
Meditate on this I will.

425
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:50,161
I wasn't the youngest queen ever elected...

426
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:53,873
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.

427
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,958
I'm not sure I was ready.

428
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:58,878
The people you served
thought you did a good job.

429
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,047
I heard they even tried
to amend the constitution...

430
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:03,216
so you could stay in office.

431
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,801
I was relieved when my two terms were up.

432
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:09,639
But when the queen asked me
to serve as senator...

433
00:39:09,723 --> 00:39:11,891
I couldn't refuse her.

434
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:15,394
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.

435
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:19,607
I'm glad that you chose to serve.

436
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:30,201
If the senate votes to create an army,
it's sure to push us into a civil war.

437
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,119
It's unthinkable!

438
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:35,623
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.

439
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,209
Do you see any way through negotiations...

440
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,419
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?

441
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:42,713
Not if they feel threatened.

442
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:46,217
They'll turn to the Trade Federations
or the Commerce Guilds for help.

443
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,261
It's outrageous...

444
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:50,680
but after four trials
in the Supreme Court...

445
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:54,558
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.

446
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:58,688
I fear the senate is powerless
to resolve this crisis.

447
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:02,984
We must keep our faith in the Republic.

448
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:13,911
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.

449
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:16,747
Let's pray that day never comes.

450
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:19,500
In the meantime,
we must consider your own safety.

451
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,586
What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?

452
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:26,090
Anakin's not a Jedi yet.
He's still a Padawan learner.

453
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,050
- But I was thinking...
- Hold on a minute.

454
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:29,427
Excuse me.

455
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:31,929
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.

456
00:40:32,014 --> 00:40:34,140
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.

457
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:37,476
Excuse me. I'm in charge
of security here, milady.

458
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:41,188
And this is my home. I know it very well.
That is why we're here.

459
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:43,274
I think it would be wise...

460
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,818
if you took advantage
of my knowledge in this instance.

461
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:49,071
Sorry, milady.

462
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:54,410
Perfect. It's settled, then.

463
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:11,135
There it is, R4, right where it should be.

464
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,054
Our missing planet Kamino.

465
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:53,094
Master Jedi.

466
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:56,597
The prime minister is expecting you.

467
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,226
- I'm expected?
- Of course.

468
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:03,354
He is anxious to meet you.

469
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,648
After all these years...

470
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:09,360
we were beginning to think
you weren't coming.

471
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,737
Now, please, this way.

472
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:27,002
May I present Lama Su...

473
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:29,130
prime minister of Kamino.

474
00:42:30,841 --> 00:42:33,050
And this is Master Jedi...

475
00:42:33,135 --> 00:42:35,052
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

476
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:38,472
I trust you're going to enjoy your stay.

477
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:41,934
Please.

478
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,729
And now to business.

479
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:49,817
You will be delighted to hear
that we are on schedule.

480
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:52,778
200,000 units are ready...

481
00:42:52,863 --> 00:42:55,281
with a million more well on the way.

482
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,325
That's good news.

483
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:01,579
Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas...

484
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:05,040
that his order will be met on time.

485
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:07,168
I'm sorry. Master...

486
00:43:08,295 --> 00:43:10,880
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still...

487
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:14,091
a leading member of the Jedi Council,
is he not?

488
00:43:14,176 --> 00:43:18,012
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.

489
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,974
I'm so sorry to hear that.

490
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:26,353
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.

491
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:28,814
The army?

492
00:43:28,899 --> 00:43:32,610
Yes, a clone army, and I must say...

493
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,904
one of the finest we've ever created.

494
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:36,989
Tell me, Prime Minister...

495
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:39,617
when my master first contacted you
about the army...

496
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:41,827
did he say who it was for?

497
00:43:41,912 --> 00:43:43,954
Of course he did.

498
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:46,749
This army is for the Republic.

499
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:51,212
But you must be anxious
to inspect the units for yourself.

500
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:54,882
That's why I'm here.

501
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,863
We used to come here for school retreat.

502
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,700
We would swim to that island every day.

503
00:44:22,953 --> 00:44:24,954
I love the water.

504
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:33,712
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us...

505
00:44:33,797 --> 00:44:36,799
and try to guess the names
of the birds singing.

506
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:41,720
I don't like sand.

507
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:46,392
It's coarse and rough and irritating...

508
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:48,561
and it gets everywhere.

509
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,773
Not like here.

510
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,401
Here, everything is soft...

511
00:44:57,404 --> 00:44:59,738
and smooth.

512
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:37,985
No.

513
00:45:38,612 --> 00:45:40,654
I shouldn't have done that.

514
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,366
I'm sorry.

515
00:45:57,964 --> 00:45:59,590
Very impressive.

516
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,842
I'd hoped you would be pleased.

517
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:07,473
Clones can think creatively.

518
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:11,518
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.

519
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:20,653
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programs.

520
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:24,114
This group was created
about five years ago.

521
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,283
You mentioned growth acceleration.

522
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:28,327
Oh, yes, it's essential.

523
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:31,455
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.

524
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:34,166
Now we can do it in half the time.

525
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,960
I see.

526
00:46:37,045 --> 00:46:38,962
They are totally obedient...

527
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:41,757
taking any order without question.

528
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:43,926
We modified their genetic structure...

529
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,221
to make them less independent
than the original host.

530
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,807
And who was the original host?

531
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:52,101
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.

532
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,688
And where is this bounty hunter now?

533
00:46:55,772 --> 00:46:58,065
Oh, we keep him here.

534
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:03,529
Apart from his pay, which
is considerable...

535
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:06,156
Fett demanded only one thing:

536
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:08,826
an unaltered clone for himself.

537
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,370
- Curious, isn't it?
- "Unaltered"?

538
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:13,997
Pure genetic replication.

539
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:17,292
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile...

540
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:19,920
and no growth acceleration.

541
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:23,340
I should very much like
to meet this Jango Fett.

542
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:26,719
I would be very happy
to arrange it for you.

543
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:47,114
Magnificent, aren't they?

544
00:47:53,163 --> 00:47:55,080
I don't know.

545
00:47:56,124 --> 00:47:58,417
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.

546
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,878
You gonna use one of your
Jedi mind tricks on me?

547
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:03,130
They only work on the weak-minded.

548
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:06,175
All right.

549
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:08,427
I was 12. His name was Palo.

550
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:11,054
We were both in the
Legislative Youth Program.

551
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:14,099
He was a few years older than I. Very cute.

552
00:48:14,184 --> 00:48:16,685
Dark, curly hair. Dreamy eyes.

553
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:19,062
All right, I get the picture.

554
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:21,064
Whatever happened to him?

555
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:23,901
I went into public service.
He went on to become an artist.

556
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:26,069
Maybe he was the smart one.

557
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:28,405
You really don't like politicians, do you?

558
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,699
I like two or three...

559
00:48:30,784 --> 00:48:32,868
but I'm not really sure about one of them.

560
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:39,082
I don't think the system works.

561
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,794
How would you have it work?

562
00:48:42,295 --> 00:48:46,423
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem...

563
00:48:46,508 --> 00:48:49,092
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people...

564
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:50,928
and then do it.

565
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:52,930
That's exactly what we do.

566
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:55,015
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.

567
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,017
Well, then they should be made to.

568
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:00,229
- By whom? Who's gonna make them?
- I don't know. Someone.

569
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:02,397
- You?
- Of course not me.

570
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:05,442
- But someone.
- Someone wise.

571
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:09,363
Sounds an awful lot like
a dictatorship to me.

572
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:13,158
Well, if it works.

573
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:22,000
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

574
00:49:22,085 --> 00:49:24,711
I'd be much too frightened
to tease a senator.

575
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,253
Ani, are you all right?

576
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:45,626
Boba, is your father here?

577
00:50:46,628 --> 00:50:47,669
Yep.

578
00:50:47,754 --> 00:50:49,838
May we see him?

579
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:52,799
Sure.

580
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:56,511
Dad, Taun We's here.

581
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:12,402
Jango, welcome back.

582
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:14,404
Was your trip productive?

583
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:16,448
Fairly.

584
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:20,410
This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

585
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:23,538
He's come to check on our progress.

586
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:26,500
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.

587
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:29,628
I'm just a simple man trying
to make my way in the universe.

588
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:33,465
Ever made your way as far
into the interior as Coruscant?

589
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:36,468
- Once or twice.
- Recently?

590
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,097
Possibly.

591
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:42,516
Then you must know Master Sifo-Dyas.

592
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,147
Boba, rood eht so-heeck.

593
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:51,733
Master who?

594
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:55,779
Sifo-Dyas.

595
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:58,532
Is he not the Jedi who
hired you for this job?

596
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:03,370
Never heard of him.

597
00:52:06,249 --> 00:52:07,374
Really?

598
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:12,462
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.

599
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:14,214
Curious.

600
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:20,512
Do you like your army?

601
00:52:21,264 --> 00:52:23,265
I look forward to seeing them in action.

602
00:52:24,517 --> 00:52:27,894
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.

603
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:30,188
Thank you for your time, Jango.

604
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,067
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

605
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:55,714
What is it, Dad?

606
00:52:56,883 --> 00:52:59,092
Pack your things. We're leaving.

607
00:53:03,765 --> 00:53:08,310
And when I got to them,
we went into aggressive negotiations.

608
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,437
"Aggressive negotiations"? What's that?

609
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:14,066
Well, negotiations with a lightsaber.

610
00:53:26,996 --> 00:53:30,165
If Master Obi-Wan caught me
doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

611
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:01,780
From the moment I met you...

612
00:54:02,824 --> 00:54:05,367
all those years ago...

613
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:08,495
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought of you.

614
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:13,625
And now that I'm with you again...

615
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:16,336
I'm in agony.

616
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:23,593
The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.

617
00:54:23,678 --> 00:54:26,179
The thought of not being with you...

618
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,974
I can't breathe.

619
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:34,729
I'm haunted by the kiss...

620
00:54:34,814 --> 00:54:38,150
that you should never have given me.

621
00:54:38,234 --> 00:54:40,610
My heart is beating...

622
00:54:40,695 --> 00:54:43,655
hoping that that kiss
will not become a scar.

623
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:48,743
You are in my very soul...

624
00:54:48,828 --> 00:54:50,871
tormenting me.

625
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:56,877
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.

626
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:11,391
If you are suffering
as much as I am, please, tell me.

627
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:15,187
I can't.

628
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:19,316
We can't. It's... just not possible.

629
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,402
Anything is possible, Padmé. Listen to me.

630
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,571
No, you listen.

631
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:28,825
We live in a real world. Come back to it.

632
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:32,579
You're studying to become a Jedi.
I'm a senator.

633
00:55:34,457 --> 00:55:36,958
If you follow your thoughts
through to conclusion...

634
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:39,586
it'll take us to a place we cannot go...

635
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:43,048
regardless of the way
we feel about each other.

636
00:55:43,132 --> 00:55:45,175
Then you do feel something.

637
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:48,345
I will not let you give
up your future for me.

638
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:50,597
You are asking me to be rational.

639
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:53,975
That is something I know I cannot do.

640
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:58,730
Believe me, I wish that
I could just wish away my feelings...

641
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:00,899
but I can't.

642
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:04,569
I will not give in to this.

643
00:56:11,619 --> 00:56:13,870
Well, you know...

644
00:56:13,955 --> 00:56:16,790
it wouldn't have to be that way.

645
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:19,793
We could keep it a secret.

646
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,213
We'd be living a lie...

647
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:25,632
one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to.

648
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:29,010
I couldn't do that.

649
00:56:29,095 --> 00:56:31,972
Could you, Anakin?
Could you live like that?

650
00:56:33,933 --> 00:56:36,977
No. You're right.

651
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:40,438
It would destroy us.

652
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:52,075
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.

653
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:55,287
And remind them, if they
need more troops...

654
00:56:55,371 --> 00:56:58,540
it will take more time to grow them.

655
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:00,417
I won't forget, and thank you.

656
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:02,377
Thank you.

657
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:20,770
R4!

658
00:57:20,855 --> 00:57:24,190
Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care of the old folks' home!

659
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:34,075
I have successfully made contact
with the prime minister of Kamino.

660
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,079
They are using a bounty hunter named
Jango Fett to create a clone army.

661
00:57:38,164 --> 00:57:40,665
I have a strong feeling
that this bounty hunter...

662
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:42,876
is the assassin we are looking for.

663
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,961
Do you think these cloners are involved...

664
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:47,130
in the plot to assassinate Senator Amidala?

665
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:50,133
No, Master. There appears to be no motive.

666
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:53,136
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.

667
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,264
Clear your mind must be...

668
00:57:56,349 --> 00:58:00,518
if you are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.

669
00:58:00,603 --> 00:58:02,479
Yes, Master.

670
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:05,648
They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed
an order for a clone army...

671
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:09,402
at the request of the senate
almost ten years ago.

672
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:15,075
I was under the impression
he was killed before that.

673
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:18,703
Did the council ever authorize
the creation of a clone army?

674
00:58:18,788 --> 00:58:20,705
No. Whoever placed that order...

675
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:23,083
did not have the authorization
of the Jedi Council.

676
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:26,878
Bring him here. Question him we will.

677
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:31,091
Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.

678
00:58:32,593 --> 00:58:38,598
Blind we are if creation of this clone army
we could not see.

679
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:44,145
I think it is time we
informed the senate...

680
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,272
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.

681
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:51,528
Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.

682
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:53,863
If informed the senate is...

683
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:56,449
multiply our adversaries will.

684
00:58:58,077 --> 00:58:59,744
No.

685
00:59:01,122 --> 00:59:03,039
Anakin! Help me!

686
00:59:03,124 --> 00:59:05,500
- Mom, no.
- Anakin!

687
00:59:33,696 --> 00:59:35,989
Don't go.

688
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:39,993
I don't want to disturb you.

689
00:59:41,162 --> 00:59:43,288
Your presence is soothing.

690
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,293
You had another nightmare last night.

691
00:59:49,462 --> 00:59:51,838
Jedi don't have nightmares.

692
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:54,382
I heard you.

693
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:01,347
I saw my mother.

694
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:06,394
She is suffering, Padmé.

695
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:12,066
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.

696
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:25,914
She is in pain.

697
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:30,376
I know I'm disobeying my mandate
to protect you, Senator...

698
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:32,504
but I have to go.

699
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:37,467
I have to help her.

700
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:41,095
I'll go with you.

701
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,473
I'm sorry. I don't have a choice.

702
01:00:54,527 --> 01:00:56,361
Dad, look!

703
01:00:57,029 --> 01:00:59,531
Boba, get on board!

704
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:17,483
Oh, not good.

705
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:28,489
Wait right there.

706
01:04:28,574 --> 01:04:30,616
Okey-okey.

707
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:34,662
Chut-chut, Watto.

708
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:38,958
Let me help you with that.

709
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,379
What? What do you want?

710
01:04:43,464 --> 01:04:45,965
Wait! You're a Jedi!

711
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:49,302
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

712
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:57,143
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

713
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:01,564
Ani?

714
01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:05,276
Little Ani?

715
01:05:08,155 --> 01:05:10,156
Nahhh.

716
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:14,660
You are Ani! It is you!

717
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:19,332
You sure sprouted, huh?

718
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,668
A Jedi! Whattaya know!

719
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:29,842
Maybe you could help with some
deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.

720
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:31,427
My mother.

721
01:05:31,512 --> 01:05:34,013
Oh, yeah. Shmi.

722
01:05:35,474 --> 01:05:38,726
She's not mine-a no more-a. I sold her.

723
01:05:38,811 --> 01:05:41,145
- You sold her?
- Years ago.

724
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:44,357
Sorry, Ani, but you know,
business is business.

725
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:49,237
I sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars.

726
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:51,364
At least I think it was Lars.

727
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:54,992
Believe it or not, I heard
he freed her and married her!

728
01:05:55,077 --> 01:05:57,370
Can ya beat that, eh?

729
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,999
Do you know where they are now?

730
01:06:02,918 --> 01:06:04,961
Long way from here.

731
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:09,549
Someplace over on the other side
of Mos Eisley, I think.

732
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,717
I'd like to know.

733
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:16,097
Sure. Absolutely!

734
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,225
Let's go look at my records, huh?

735
01:06:47,588 --> 01:06:50,673
Dad! I think we're being tracked!

736
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:54,218
He must have put a homing
device on our hull.

737
01:06:54,303 --> 01:06:56,596
Hang on, son.
We'll move into the asteroid field...

738
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,557
and we'll have a couple
of surprises for him.

739
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,528
Seismic charges!

740
01:07:12,613 --> 01:07:13,988
Stand by.

741
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:41,974
He doesn't seem to take a hint, this guy.

742
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:01,827
Watch out!

743
01:08:21,515 --> 01:08:24,350
Get him, Dad! Fire!

744
01:08:26,186 --> 01:08:28,813
Blast! This is why I hate flying!

745
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:50,334
We got him!

746
01:08:50,419 --> 01:08:52,503
We'll just have to finish him.

747
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:21,949
R4, prepare to jettison
the spare part canisters.

748
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:27,830
Fire them now!

749
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:43,387
We won't be seeing him again.

750
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:19,924
Well, R4, I think we've waited long enough.

751
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:44,448
There's an unusual concentration
of Federation ships over there, R4.

752
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:22,486
Stay with the ship, R2.

753
01:11:37,085 --> 01:11:41,005
Hello. How might I be of service? I am C...

754
01:11:41,089 --> 01:11:43,007
3PO?

755
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:46,719
The maker!

756
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:48,470
Master Ani!

757
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:51,390
I knew you would return. I knew it!

758
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:53,225
And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.

759
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:54,935
Hello, 3PO.

760
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:58,939
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.

761
01:11:59,024 --> 01:12:01,066
I've come to see my mother.

762
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,904
I think perhaps we'd better go indoors.

763
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:12,369
Master Owen, might I present
two most important visitors.

764
01:12:12,454 --> 01:12:14,788
I'm Anakin Skywalker.

765
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:17,666
Owen Lars.

766
01:12:17,751 --> 01:12:19,960
- This is my girlfriend, Beru.
- Hello.

767
01:12:20,045 --> 01:12:22,338
I'm Padmé.

768
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:24,840
I guess I'm your stepbrother.

769
01:12:24,925 --> 01:12:27,843
I had a feeling you might show up someday.

770
01:12:28,929 --> 01:12:30,387
Is my mother here?

771
01:12:30,472 --> 01:12:32,223
No, she's not.

772
01:12:33,225 --> 01:12:35,100
Cliegg Lars.

773
01:12:35,185 --> 01:12:37,269
Shmi is my wife.

774
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:41,357
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.

775
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:52,034
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.

776
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:55,079
A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.

777
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:58,958
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did...

778
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:02,461
to pick mushrooms that
grow on the vaporators.

779
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:06,715
From the tracks, she was
about halfway home...

780
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,759
when they took her.

781
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:12,388
Those Tuskens walk like men...

782
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:17,142
but they're vicious, mindless monsters.

783
01:13:18,812 --> 01:13:21,981
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.

784
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:27,069
I'd be out there with them,
but after I lost my leg...

785
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:32,825
I just couldn't ride anymore until I heal.

786
01:13:33,368 --> 01:13:35,661
I don't want to give up on her...

787
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:38,622
but she's been gone a month.

788
01:13:38,707 --> 01:13:41,750
There's little hope she's lasted this long.

789
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:48,882
Where are you going?

790
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:51,010
To find my mother.

791
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:55,097
Your mother's dead, son. Accept it.

792
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:20,247
You're gonna have to stay here.

793
01:14:20,332 --> 01:14:23,042
These are good people, Padmé.
You'll be safe.

794
01:14:35,555 --> 01:14:37,639
I won't be long.

795
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:28,584
We must persuade the Commerce Guild...

796
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:31,128
and the Corporate Alliance
to sign the treaty.

797
01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:34,006
What about the senator from Naboo?

798
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:36,675
Is she dead yet?

799
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:41,346
I am not signing your treaty
until I have her head on my desk.

800
01:16:41,431 --> 01:16:43,765
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.

801
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:46,935
With these new battle droids
we've built for you...

802
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:50,189
you'll have the finest army in the galaxy.

803
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:03,035
As I explained to you earlier...

804
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:06,371
I am quite convinced
that 10,000 more systems...

805
01:17:06,456 --> 01:17:09,333
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.

806
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:13,212
What you are proposing
could be construed as treason.

807
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:15,839
The Techno Union army...

808
01:17:19,052 --> 01:17:21,887
is at your disposal, Count.

809
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:26,225
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.

810
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:28,227
Good. Very good.

811
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:32,981
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support...

812
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:35,734
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours...

813
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:38,904
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.

814
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:42,407
The Jedi will be overwhelmed.

815
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:47,329
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.

816
01:18:48,141 --> 01:18:50,142
Mom?

817
01:18:52,437 --> 01:18:54,563
Ani?

818
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:57,608
Ani?

819
01:18:58,818 --> 01:19:00,485
Is it you?

820
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:04,156
I'm here, Mom. You're safe.

821
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:13,540
You look so handsome.

822
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:19,046
My son.

823
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:21,923
My grown-up son.

824
01:19:23,426 --> 01:19:25,719
I'm so proud of you, Ani.

825
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:27,763
I missed you.

826
01:19:30,475 --> 01:19:32,643
Now I am complete.

827
01:19:38,608 --> 01:19:41,693
I love y...

828
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:45,947
Stay with me, Mom. Everything...

829
01:19:46,032 --> 01:19:48,200
I love...

830
01:19:49,661 --> 01:19:52,162
I love...

831
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:51,263
Anakin!

832
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:53,265
No!

833
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:15,328
What is it?

834
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:19,875
Pain, suffering...

835
01:21:20,418 --> 01:21:22,461
death I feel.

836
01:21:26,966 --> 01:21:30,135
Something terrible has happened.

837
01:21:32,764 --> 01:21:35,807
Young Skywalker is in pain...

838
01:21:35,892 --> 01:21:37,809
terrible pain.

839
01:21:42,565 --> 01:21:46,234
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.

840
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:49,112
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?

841
01:21:50,615 --> 01:21:52,657
We'll have to try something else.

842
01:21:55,495 --> 01:21:58,580
Maybe we can contact Anakin on Naboo.

843
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:00,332
It's much closer.

844
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:04,503
Anakin, do you copy?

845
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:07,589
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?

846
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:10,008
He's not on Naboo, R4.

847
01:22:11,552 --> 01:22:13,762
I'm going to try and widen the range.

848
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:19,184
I do hope nothing's happened to him.

849
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:28,527
That's Anakin's tracking
signal, all right...

850
01:22:28,611 --> 01:22:31,112
but it's coming from Tatooine.

851
01:22:32,657 --> 01:22:35,283
What in the blazes is he doing there?

852
01:22:35,368 --> 01:22:37,369
I told him to stay on Naboo.

853
01:22:40,832 --> 01:22:42,541
We haven't got much time.

854
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,709
Anakin, do you copy?

855
01:22:44,794 --> 01:22:46,878
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

856
01:22:54,762 --> 01:22:56,721
Retransmit this message...

857
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:01,434
Anakin, do you copy?

858
01:23:01,519 --> 01:23:03,895
My long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.

859
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:06,398
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.

860
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:52,903
I brought you something.

861
01:23:52,987 --> 01:23:55,113
Are you hungry?

862
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:58,867
The shifter broke.

863
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:03,538
Life seems so much simpler
when you're fixing things.

864
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:09,461
I'm good at fixing things. Always was.

865
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:13,798
But I couldn't...

866
01:24:17,637 --> 01:24:19,721
Why'd she have to die?

867
01:24:23,142 --> 01:24:25,310
Why couldn't I save her?

868
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:27,479
I know I could have!

869
01:24:30,149 --> 01:24:32,817
Sometimes there are things no one can fix.

870
01:24:34,487 --> 01:24:37,155
- You're not all-powerful, Ani.
- Well, I should be!

871
01:24:39,909 --> 01:24:42,160
Someday I will be.

872
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:44,913
I will be the most powerful Jedi ever.

873
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:48,667
I promise you.

874
01:24:49,335 --> 01:24:51,795
I will even learn to
stop people from dying.

875
01:24:55,383 --> 01:24:59,511
It's all Obi-Wan's fault! He's jealous!

876
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:01,680
He's holding me back!

877
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:08,103
What's wrong, Ani?

878
01:25:18,656 --> 01:25:20,824
I killed them.

879
01:25:22,368 --> 01:25:24,536
I killed them all.

880
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:28,248
They're dead.

881
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:30,458
Every single one of them.

882
01:25:32,503 --> 01:25:34,546
And not just the men...

883
01:25:36,465 --> 01:25:38,550
but the women...

884
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:40,593
and the children too.

885
01:25:41,512 --> 01:25:43,596
They're like animals...

886
01:25:43,681 --> 01:25:46,057
and I slaughtered them like animals!

887
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:49,686
I hate them!

888
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:09,497
To be angry is to be human.

889
01:26:09,582 --> 01:26:11,499
I'm a Jedi.

890
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:14,502
I know I'm better than this.

891
01:26:28,309 --> 01:26:33,021
I know wherever you are
it's become a better place.

892
01:26:33,105 --> 01:26:38,276
You were the most loving partner
a man could ever have.

893
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:43,281
Good-bye, my darling wife.

894
01:26:47,244 --> 01:26:49,245
And thank you.

895
01:27:16,357 --> 01:27:18,775
I wasn't strong enough to save you, Mom.

896
01:27:21,237 --> 01:27:23,154
I wasn't strong enough.

897
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:31,079
But I promise I won't fail again.

898
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:44,092
I miss you...

899
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:47,387
so much.

900
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:57,021
R2? What are you doing here?

901
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:04,195
It seems that he is carrying
a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

902
01:28:04,989 --> 01:28:08,283
Master Ani, does that name
mean anything to you?

903
01:28:10,369 --> 01:28:12,871
Anakin, my long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.

904
01:28:12,955 --> 01:28:15,248
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.

905
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:21,963
I have tracked the bounty hunter,
Jango Fett...

906
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:24,215
to the droid foundries on Geonosis.

907
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:27,969
The Trade Federation is
to take delivery of a droid army here...

908
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:30,096
and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray...

909
01:28:30,181 --> 01:28:33,683
is behind the assassination attempts
on Senator Amidala.

910
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:35,935
The Commerce Guilds
and the Corporate Alliance...

911
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:39,731
have both pledged their armies
to Count Dooku and are forming...

912
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:41,900
Wait.

913
01:28:52,703 --> 01:28:57,373
More happening on Geonosis, I feel,
than has been revealed.

914
01:28:57,458 --> 01:28:59,250
I agree.

915
01:29:00,628 --> 01:29:02,921
We will deal with Count Dooku.

916
01:29:03,005 --> 01:29:06,591
The most important thing for you
is to stay where you are.

917
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:09,427
Protect the senator at all costs.

918
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:12,096
That is your first priority.

919
01:29:13,474 --> 01:29:15,475
Understood, Master.

920
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:17,518
They'll never get there
in time to save him.

921
01:29:17,603 --> 01:29:20,897
They have to come halfway
across the galaxy. Look.

922
01:29:23,025 --> 01:29:25,151
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

923
01:29:25,236 --> 01:29:27,237
If he's still alive.

924
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:31,783
Are you just gonna sit
here and let him die?

925
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:34,452
- He's your friend, your mentor.
- He's like my father!

926
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:39,290
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here.

927
01:29:39,375 --> 01:29:42,627
He gave you strict orders to protect me...

928
01:29:42,711 --> 01:29:44,963
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.

929
01:29:46,298 --> 01:29:49,884
If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along.

930
01:29:53,764 --> 01:29:57,100
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.

931
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:10,321
The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war.
There can be no doubt of that.

932
01:30:10,406 --> 01:30:12,407
Count Dooku must have
made a treaty with them.

933
01:30:12,491 --> 01:30:15,910
The debate is over.

934
01:30:15,995 --> 01:30:18,997
Now we need that clone army.

935
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:22,041
Unfortunately, the debate is not over.

936
01:30:22,126 --> 01:30:24,585
The senate will never approve
the use of clones...

937
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:26,462
before the separatists attack.

938
01:30:26,547 --> 01:30:28,423
This is a crisis.

939
01:30:28,507 --> 01:30:31,676
The senate must vote the chancellor
emergency powers.

940
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,096
He can then approve the
creation of an army.

941
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:37,390
But what senator would have the courage...

942
01:30:37,474 --> 01:30:40,059
to propose such a radical amendment?

943
01:30:40,144 --> 01:30:44,272
If only Senator Amidala were here.

944
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:07,879
Traitor.

945
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:11,132
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.

946
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:13,343
They have gone too far. This is madness.

947
01:31:13,427 --> 01:31:16,054
I thought you were the leader here, Dooku.

948
01:31:16,138 --> 01:31:18,765
This had nothing to do
with me, I assure you.

949
01:31:18,849 --> 01:31:22,310
I will petition immediately
to have you set free.

950
01:31:22,394 --> 01:31:26,064
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long.
I have work to do.

951
01:31:26,148 --> 01:31:29,984
May I ask why a Jedi knight...

952
01:31:30,069 --> 01:31:32,528
is all the way out here on Geonosis?

953
01:31:32,613 --> 01:31:35,490
I've been tracking a bounty hunter
named Jango Fett.

954
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:37,283
Do you know him?

955
01:31:37,368 --> 01:31:40,161
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.

956
01:31:40,245 --> 01:31:42,246
The Geonosians don't trust them.

957
01:31:42,331 --> 01:31:45,249
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.

958
01:31:46,335 --> 01:31:50,546
It's a great pity our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.

959
01:31:51,173 --> 01:31:53,674
Qui-Gon always spoke very highly of you.

960
01:31:58,514 --> 01:32:00,598
I wish he were still alive.

961
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:04,769
I could use his help right now.

962
01:32:05,604 --> 01:32:08,106
Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.

963
01:32:09,858 --> 01:32:12,777
Don't be so sure, my young Jedi.

964
01:32:12,861 --> 01:32:15,446
You forget that he was
once my apprentice...

965
01:32:15,531 --> 01:32:17,615
just as you were once his.

966
01:32:18,534 --> 01:32:20,743
He knew all about the corruption
in the senate...

967
01:32:20,828 --> 01:32:23,913
but he wouldn't have gone along with
it if he had learned the truth as I have.

968
01:32:23,997 --> 01:32:26,791
- The truth?
- The truth.

969
01:32:33,132 --> 01:32:35,883
What if I told you that the Republic
was now under the control...

970
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:38,219
of the dark lord of the Sith?

971
01:32:38,303 --> 01:32:41,639
No, that's not possible.
The Jedi would be aware of it.

972
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:45,977
The dark side of the Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.

973
01:32:47,104 --> 01:32:49,689
Hundreds of senators
are now under the influence...

974
01:32:49,773 --> 01:32:54,444
of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.

975
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,071
I don't believe you.

976
01:32:57,156 --> 01:32:59,574
The viceroy of the Trade Federation...

977
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:02,910
was once in league with
this Darth Sidious...

978
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:07,623
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.

979
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:10,835
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.

980
01:33:12,838 --> 01:33:14,922
You must join me, Obi-Wan...

981
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:20,136
and together we will destroy the Sith!

982
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:24,140
I will never join you, Dooku.

983
01:33:33,442 --> 01:33:36,527
It may be difficult to secure your release.

984
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:50,041
It's-a clear desa separatists made a pact
wesa desa Federation du Trade.

985
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:54,462
Senators, "dellow felagates":

986
01:33:54,546 --> 01:33:58,591
In response to this direct threat
to the Republic...

987
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:02,386
mesa propose that the senate...

988
01:34:02,471 --> 01:34:06,140
give immediately emergency powers...

989
01:34:06,225 --> 01:34:08,893
to the supreme chancellor.

990
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:15,107
Palpatine! Palpatine!

991
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:21,447
Order! We shall have order!

992
01:34:23,075 --> 01:34:26,452
It is with great reluctance...

993
01:34:26,537 --> 01:34:28,663
that I have agreed to this calling.

994
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:34,001
I love democracy. I love the Republic.

995
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:37,046
The power you give me...

996
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:41,676
I will lay down when
this crisis has abated.

997
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:50,977
And as my first act with
this new authority...

998
01:34:51,061 --> 01:34:55,481
I will create a grand
army of the Republic...

999
01:34:55,566 --> 01:34:59,360
to counter the increasing threats
of the separatists.

1000
01:35:00,696 --> 01:35:02,613
It is done, then.

1001
01:35:07,786 --> 01:35:11,581
I will take what Jedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

1002
01:35:11,665 --> 01:35:15,585
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino...

1003
01:35:16,587 --> 01:35:20,881
and see this army
they have created for the Republic.

1004
01:35:40,944 --> 01:35:43,029
See those columns of steam straight ahead?

1005
01:35:43,113 --> 01:35:45,197
They're exhaust vents of some type.

1006
01:35:45,991 --> 01:35:48,034
That'll do.

1007
01:35:57,336 --> 01:36:00,421
Look, whatever happens
out there, follow my lead.

1008
01:36:00,505 --> 01:36:02,590
I'm not interested in
getting into a war here.

1009
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:04,383
As a member of the senate...

1010
01:36:04,468 --> 01:36:07,845
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.

1011
01:36:07,929 --> 01:36:09,930
Don't worry.

1012
01:36:10,015 --> 01:36:12,475
I've given up trying to argue with you.

1013
01:36:17,189 --> 01:36:20,441
My obtuse little friend,
if they had needed our help...

1014
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:22,443
they would have asked for it.

1015
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:25,696
You obviously have a great deal
to learn about human behavior.

1016
01:36:51,556 --> 01:36:54,767
For a mechanic, you seem to do
an excessive amount of thinking.

1017
01:36:56,812 --> 01:36:59,438
I am programmed to understand humans!

1018
01:37:02,984 --> 01:37:04,902
"What does that mean?"

1019
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:07,738
That means I am in charge here!

1020
01:37:07,823 --> 01:37:09,490
Where are you going now?

1021
01:37:09,574 --> 01:37:13,327
You don't know what's out there.
Have you no sense at all?

1022
01:37:13,412 --> 01:37:15,162
Idiot!

1023
01:37:17,249 --> 01:37:19,083
Please wait.

1024
01:37:19,876 --> 01:37:21,877
Do you know where you're going?

1025
01:37:34,307 --> 01:37:36,100
Wait.

1026
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:53,594
Oh, my goodness!

1027
01:38:53,678 --> 01:38:55,304
Shut me down!

1028
01:38:56,181 --> 01:38:58,349
Machines making machines.

1029
01:38:58,433 --> 01:38:59,975
How perverse!

1030
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:02,311
Calm down, R2!

1031
01:39:02,395 --> 01:39:04,897
I almost fell.

1032
01:39:04,981 --> 01:39:07,024
You'll get your chance...

1033
01:39:08,819 --> 01:39:10,861
I'm scrap.

1034
01:39:11,863 --> 01:39:14,281
It's a nightmare!

1035
01:39:16,034 --> 01:39:18,035
I want to go home!

1036
01:39:19,538 --> 01:39:21,497
What did I do to deserve this?

1037
01:40:01,204 --> 01:40:03,622
I wonder what happened to poor little R2.

1038
01:40:03,707 --> 01:40:06,125
He's always getting himself into trouble.

1039
01:40:07,419 --> 01:40:09,086
Oh, no!

1040
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:20,139
Uh-oh.

1041
01:40:23,727 --> 01:40:25,769
I'm so confused.

1042
01:42:21,678 --> 01:42:23,637
Not again!

1043
01:42:23,722 --> 01:42:25,764
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.

1044
01:42:34,774 --> 01:42:36,316
Don't move, Jedi!

1045
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:37,943
Take him away.

1046
01:42:56,921 --> 01:42:58,797
Don't be afraid.

1047
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:02,593
I'm not afraid to die.

1048
01:43:07,348 --> 01:43:11,560
I've been dying a little bit each day
since you came back into my life.

1049
01:43:12,771 --> 01:43:15,397
What are you talking about?

1050
01:43:16,691 --> 01:43:18,942
I love you.

1051
01:43:22,614 --> 01:43:24,615
You love me?

1052
01:43:29,079 --> 01:43:32,372
I thought we had decided
not to fall in love...

1053
01:43:34,084 --> 01:43:37,127
that we would be forced to live a lie...

1054
01:43:37,962 --> 01:43:41,006
and that it would destroy our lives.

1055
01:43:41,633 --> 01:43:44,134
I think our lives are about
to be destroyed anyway.

1056
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:51,141
I truly...

1057
01:43:52,102 --> 01:43:54,561
deeply love you...

1058
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:58,315
and before we die, I want you to know.

1059
01:44:55,456 --> 01:44:58,125
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd got my message.

1060
01:44:58,209 --> 01:45:01,295
I retransmitted it
just as you had requested, Master.

1061
01:45:03,631 --> 01:45:05,549
Then we decided to come and rescue you.

1062
01:45:06,467 --> 01:45:08,051
Good job.

1063
01:45:20,356 --> 01:45:23,442
Settle down. Settle down.

1064
01:45:27,405 --> 01:45:31,200
Let the executions begin.

1065
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:06,902
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1066
01:46:32,387 --> 01:46:34,930
- Just relax. Concentrate.
- What about Padmé?

1067
01:46:35,014 --> 01:46:37,182
She seems to be on top of things.

1068
01:47:40,121 --> 01:47:41,872
She can't do that!

1069
01:47:41,956 --> 01:47:43,915
Shoot her... or something!

1070
01:49:02,703 --> 01:49:04,162
Jump!

1071
01:49:28,229 --> 01:49:31,314
This isn't how it's supposed to be!

1072
01:49:31,399 --> 01:49:33,567
Jango! Finish her off!

1073
01:49:33,651 --> 01:49:36,903
Patience, Viceroy, patience. She will die.

1074
01:50:07,685 --> 01:50:09,227
Master Windu.

1075
01:50:09,312 --> 01:50:11,646
How pleasant of you to join us.

1076
01:50:11,731 --> 01:50:13,815
This party's over.

1077
01:50:27,330 --> 01:50:29,623
Brave...

1078
01:50:29,707 --> 01:50:32,083
but foolish, my old Jedi friend.

1079
01:50:32,168 --> 01:50:34,044
You're impossibly outnumbered.

1080
01:50:34,128 --> 01:50:36,463
I don't think so.

1081
01:50:36,547 --> 01:50:38,048
We'll see.

1082
01:51:16,754 --> 01:51:19,422
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.

1083
01:51:59,005 --> 01:52:01,590
What's all this noise? A battle!

1084
01:52:01,674 --> 01:52:03,883
There's been some terrible mistake!

1085
01:52:03,968 --> 01:52:06,761
I'm programmed for etiquette,
not destruction!

1086
01:53:34,225 --> 01:53:36,101
Die, Jedi dogs!

1087
01:53:36,185 --> 01:53:38,019
Oh! What did I say?

1088
01:53:47,029 --> 01:53:50,407
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1089
01:53:55,996 --> 01:53:58,957
Excuse me. I'm trapped. I can't get up.

1090
01:54:12,847 --> 01:54:16,933
- You call this a diplomatic solution?
- No, I call it aggressive negotiations.

1091
01:54:22,022 --> 01:54:24,065
- Uh-oh.
- Roger, roger.

1092
01:54:42,168 --> 01:54:44,461
R2, what are you doing here?

1093
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:49,007
What are you doing?

1094
01:54:49,091 --> 01:54:51,718
Stop that!
You're going to strain something.

1095
01:54:51,802 --> 01:54:53,636
My neck!

1096
01:54:55,890 --> 01:54:58,975
Now where are you taking me?
This is such a drag!

1097
01:55:03,939 --> 01:55:06,024
I'm quite beside myself.

1098
01:55:14,700 --> 01:55:17,952
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!

1099
01:55:19,371 --> 01:55:21,956
Yes, but is my head on straight?

1100
01:55:44,647 --> 01:55:46,314
Master Windu...

1101
01:55:46,398 --> 01:55:48,691
you have fought gallantly...

1102
01:55:49,777 --> 01:55:53,863
worthy of recognition
in the archives of the Jedi order.

1103
01:55:55,783 --> 01:55:57,158
Now...

1104
01:55:58,035 --> 01:56:00,495
it is finished.

1105
01:56:00,579 --> 01:56:02,580
Surrender...

1106
01:56:02,665 --> 01:56:05,416
and your lives will be spared.

1107
01:56:06,126 --> 01:56:09,379
We will not be hostages
to be bartered, Dooku!

1108
01:56:09,463 --> 01:56:10,547
Then...

1109
01:56:11,966 --> 01:56:14,092
I'm sorry, old friend.

1110
01:56:24,728 --> 01:56:26,229
Look!

1111
01:56:37,908 --> 01:56:42,203
Around the survivors a perimeter create.

1112
01:57:38,636 --> 01:57:41,763
I've had the most peculiar dream!

1113
01:57:52,316 --> 01:57:54,317
If Dooku escapes...

1114
01:57:54,401 --> 01:57:58,154
rally more systems to his cause he will.

1115
01:58:02,660 --> 01:58:04,494
Hold on!

1116
01:58:09,041 --> 01:58:11,042
Aim right above the fuel cells!

1117
01:58:17,341 --> 01:58:19,634
Good call, my young Padawan.

1118
01:58:33,649 --> 01:58:36,192
The Jedi have amassed a huge army.

1119
01:58:36,276 --> 01:58:38,444
That doesn't seem possible.

1120
01:58:38,529 --> 01:58:41,155
How could the Jedi
come up with an army so quickly?

1121
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:44,701
We must send all available
droids into battle.

1122
01:58:44,785 --> 01:58:46,744
There are too many.

1123
01:58:47,454 --> 01:58:50,498
Our communications have been jammed.

1124
01:58:58,382 --> 01:59:01,592
Pilot, land in that assembly area!

1125
01:59:01,677 --> 01:59:03,052
Yes, sir.

1126
01:59:11,061 --> 01:59:15,064
Sir. I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.

1127
01:59:16,066 --> 01:59:19,402
To the forward command center take me.

1128
01:59:42,676 --> 01:59:45,470
Attack those Federation starships, quickly!

1129
01:59:56,398 --> 02:00:00,234
Master Yoda,
all forward positions are advancing.

1130
02:00:00,319 --> 02:00:02,195
Very good.

1131
02:00:02,780 --> 02:00:04,447
Very good.

1132
02:00:32,643 --> 02:00:34,811
This is not looking good at all!

1133
02:00:36,313 --> 02:00:39,315
We must get the starships back into space.

1134
02:00:42,319 --> 02:00:46,280
We have to order a retreat.

1135
02:00:46,365 --> 02:00:48,741
My master will never allow the Republic...

1136
02:00:48,826 --> 02:00:51,202
to get away with this treachery.

1137
02:00:51,286 --> 02:00:54,539
I'm sending my warriors
to hide in the catacombs.

1138
02:00:55,290 --> 02:00:58,668
The Jedi must not find
our designs for the ultimate weapon.

1139
02:01:01,088 --> 02:01:06,467
If they find out what we are planning
to build, we're doomed.

1140
02:01:09,513 --> 02:01:12,140
I will take the designs
with me to Coruscant.

1141
02:01:12,933 --> 02:01:15,768
They will be much safer
there with my master.

1142
02:02:10,282 --> 02:02:15,077
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.

1143
02:02:15,162 --> 02:02:17,038
Yes, sir.

1144
02:02:17,122 --> 02:02:20,625
Move all quadrants to sector 515.

1145
02:03:00,707 --> 02:03:02,250
Look over there!

1146
02:03:05,671 --> 02:03:08,089
It's Dooku! Shoot him down!

1147
02:03:08,173 --> 02:03:10,091
We're out of rockets, sir.

1148
02:03:10,175 --> 02:03:13,052
- Follow him!
- We're gonna need some help!

1149
02:03:13,136 --> 02:03:17,265
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!

1150
02:03:40,664 --> 02:03:43,291
Put the ship down!

1151
02:03:43,375 --> 02:03:45,293
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way!

1152
02:03:45,377 --> 02:03:47,169
Follow that speeder!

1153
02:03:53,218 --> 02:03:55,594
- Lower the ship!
- I can't take Dooku alone!

1154
02:03:55,679 --> 02:03:59,181
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!

1155
02:03:59,266 --> 02:04:02,310
- We have a job to do!
- I don't care! Put the ship down!

1156
02:04:02,394 --> 02:04:04,687
You will be expelled from the Jedi order!

1157
02:04:04,771 --> 02:04:08,024
- I can't leave her!
- Come to your senses!

1158
02:04:08,108 --> 02:04:10,818
What do you think Padmé would do
were she in your position?

1159
02:04:15,365 --> 02:04:17,450
She would do her duty.

1160
02:04:26,376 --> 02:04:28,377
The droid army is in full retreat.

1161
02:04:28,462 --> 02:04:31,714
Well done, Commander. Bring me a ship.

1162
02:04:58,784 --> 02:05:01,827
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi
that you killed today, Dooku.

1163
02:05:01,912 --> 02:05:03,621
We'll take him together.

1164
02:05:03,705 --> 02:05:05,748
- I'm taking him now!
- No, Anakin! No!

1165
02:05:13,757 --> 02:05:17,343
As you see, my Jedi powers
are far beyond yours.

1166
02:05:17,427 --> 02:05:19,428
Now... back down.

1167
02:05:25,227 --> 02:05:27,103
I don't think so.

1168
02:05:39,408 --> 02:05:42,618
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.

1169
02:05:42,702 --> 02:05:45,830
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.

1170
02:05:48,166 --> 02:05:50,626
Surely you can do better.

1171
02:06:01,763 --> 02:06:03,681
Are you all right?

1172
02:06:03,765 --> 02:06:05,474
Uh-huh.

1173
02:06:06,059 --> 02:06:08,352
We'd better get back
to the forward command center.

1174
02:06:08,437 --> 02:06:10,062
No.

1175
02:06:10,147 --> 02:06:13,691
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.

1176
02:06:13,775 --> 02:06:15,734
Get a transport. Hurry!

1177
02:06:15,819 --> 02:06:16,986
Right away.

1178
02:06:42,053 --> 02:06:43,971
Brave of you, boy.

1179
02:06:45,182 --> 02:06:47,433
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.

1180
02:06:47,517 --> 02:06:49,185
I am a slow learner.

1181
02:07:51,581 --> 02:07:53,374
Master Yoda.

1182
02:07:53,458 --> 02:07:56,544
Count Dooku.

1183
02:07:56,628 --> 02:08:00,005
You have interfered with our affairs
for the last time.

1184
02:08:31,121 --> 02:08:34,540
Powerful you have become, Dooku.

1185
02:08:34,624 --> 02:08:37,835
The dark side I sense in you.

1186
02:08:37,919 --> 02:08:40,754
I've become more powerful than any Jedi.

1187
02:08:41,798 --> 02:08:43,507
Even you.

1188
02:08:58,648 --> 02:09:01,942
Much to learn you still have.

1189
02:09:02,027 --> 02:09:05,237
It is obvious that this contest
cannot be decided...

1190
02:09:05,322 --> 02:09:07,615
by our knowledge of the Force...

1191
02:09:09,492 --> 02:09:12,286
but by our skills with a lightsaber.

1192
02:09:53,703 --> 02:09:57,247
Fought well you have, my old Padawan.

1193
02:09:57,332 --> 02:09:59,166
This is just the beginning.

1194
02:12:32,111 --> 02:12:34,780
The Force is with us, Master Sidious.

1195
02:12:34,864 --> 02:12:37,866
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.

1196
02:12:39,577 --> 02:12:42,329
You have done well.

1197
02:12:42,413 --> 02:12:44,540
I have good news for you, my lord.

1198
02:12:45,917 --> 02:12:49,419
- The war has begun.
- Excellent.

1199
02:12:49,504 --> 02:12:52,381
Everything is going as planned.

1200
02:13:02,308 --> 02:13:06,311
Do you believe what Count Dooku said
about Sidious controlling the senate?

1201
02:13:06,813 --> 02:13:09,064
It doesn't feel right.

1202
02:13:09,148 --> 02:13:12,192
Joined the dark side Dooku has.

1203
02:13:13,736 --> 02:13:15,195
Lies, deceit...

1204
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:19,074
creating mistrust are his ways now.

1205
02:13:19,158 --> 02:13:20,617
Nevertheless...

1206
02:13:20,702 --> 02:13:23,745
I feel we should keep
a closer eye on the senate.

1207
02:13:23,830 --> 02:13:25,914
I agree.

1208
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:28,917
Where is your apprentice?

1209
02:13:29,002 --> 02:13:32,921
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.

1210
02:13:34,674 --> 02:13:38,343
I have to admit that without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.

1211
02:13:38,428 --> 02:13:40,554
Victory?

1212
02:13:41,264 --> 02:13:43,765
Victory, you say?

1213
02:13:43,850 --> 02:13:47,603
Master Obi-Wan, not victory.

1214
02:13:48,980 --> 02:13:52,357
The shroud of the dark side has fallen.

1215
02:13:53,776 --> 02:13:57,279
Begun the Clone War has.

1216
02:22:25,830 --> 02:22:26,830
English - US

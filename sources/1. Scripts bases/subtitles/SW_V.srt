1
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:35,507
Echo Three to Echo Seven.

2
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,634
Han, old buddy, do you read me?

3
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,803
Loud and clear, kid. What's up?

4
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,597
I finished my circle.
I don't pick up any life readings.

5
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,642
There isn't enough life on this ice cube
to fill a space cruiser.

6
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,560
The sensors are placed. I'm going back.

7
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,562
Right. I'll see you shortly.

8
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:51,773
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

9
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,109
I want to check it out. It won't take long.

10
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:55,318
Steady.

11
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:59,989
Steady, girl. What's the matter?
You smell something?

12
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,949
Chewie. Chewie?

13
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:51,166
All right. Don't lose your temper.

14
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,710
I'll come right back and give you a hand.

15
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,356
Solo.

16
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:18,234
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.

17
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,154
- You'll know if anything comes around.
- Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

18
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:24,073
No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

19
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:27,702
With all the meteor activity, it's gonna
be difficult to spot approaching ships.

20
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,746
General, I gotta leave. I can't stay anymore.

21
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,624
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- There's a price on my head.

22
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,168
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt,
I'm a dead man.

23
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,128
A death mark's not an easy thing to live with.

24
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,216
You're a good fighter, Solo.
I hate to lose you.

25
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,759
Thank you, General.

26
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,894
Well, Your Highness, guess this is it.

27
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:54,896
That's right.

28
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,109
Don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess.

29
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:04,322
Han.

30
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,202
- Yes, Your Highnessness.
- I thought you had decided to stay.

31
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,163
The bounty hunter we ran into
in Ord Mantell changed my mind.

32
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:14,540
Han, we need you.

33
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,751
- We need?
- Yes.

34
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,337
- What about you need?
- I need?

35
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,923
I don't know what you're talking about.

36
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,551
- You probably don't.
- What precisely am I supposed to know?

37
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:29,138
Come on. You want me to stay because
of the way you feel about me.

38
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,849
Yes. You're a great help to us.
You're a natural leader.

39
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,519
No. That's not it.

40
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,271
Come on.

41
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,565
- Come on.
- You're imagining things.

42
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,609
Am I? Then why are you following me?

43
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:43,945
Afraid I'd leave
without giving you a good-bye kiss?

44
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,656
- I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
- I can arrange that.

45
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,908
You could use a good kiss!

46
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,662
Don't blame me. I didn't ask you
to turn on the thermal heater.

47
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,207
I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess's chamber.

48
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:58,167
It's supposed to be freezing.

49
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,712
How we're going to dry
her clothes I really don't know.

50
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,046
Oh, switch off!

51
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:05,258
Why did you take this apart now?
I'm trying to get us out of here.

52
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,510
- Excuse me.
- Put them back together right now.

53
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,679
- Might I have a word?
- What do you want?

54
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,307
Princess Leia's been trying
to get you on the communicator.

55
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,600
I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.

56
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:17,603
Princess Leia is wondering about
Master Luke. He hasn't come back.

57
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,981
- She doesn't know where he is.
- I don't know where he is.

58
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,900
- Nobody knows where he is.
- What do you mean, nobody knows?

59
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,319
Deck Officer.

60
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,946
- Deck Officer.
- Excuse me, sir. Might I...

61
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:28,823
Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?

62
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,617
I haven't seen him. It's possible
he came in the south entrance.

63
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,953
It's possible? Why don't you go find out?

64
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:36,622
- It's getting dark out there.
- Yes, sir.

65
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,125
Excuse me, sir.
Might I inquire what's going on?

66
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,544
- Why not?
- Impossible man.

67
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,671
Come along, R2. Let's find Princess Leia.

68
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:46,883
Between ourselves, I think
Master Luke is in considerable danger.

69
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,644
Commander Skywalker
hasn't come in the south entrance.

70
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,230
- Maybe he forgot to check in.
- Not likely. Are the speeders ready?

71
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,441
Not yet. We're having trouble
adapting them to the cold.

72
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,527
- We'll have to go out on tauntauns.
- The temperature's dropping too rapidly.

73
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,696
That's right, and my friend's out in it.

74
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,953
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.

75
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,122
Then I'll see you in hell.

76
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:37,845
You must come along now, R2.

77
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,014
There's really nothing more we can do.

78
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,225
And my joints are freezing up.

79
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:47,230
Don't say things like that.
Of course we'll see Master Luke again.

80
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,107
And he'll be quite all right. You'll see.

81
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:53,903
Stupid little short circuit.
He'll be quite all right.

82
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,297
Sir, all the patrols are in. Still no...

83
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:58,384
Still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.

84
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:02,597
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals...

85
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:06,100
although he admits that his own range
is far too weak to abandon all hope.

86
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,352
Your Highness,
there's nothing more we can do tonight.

87
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,813
The shield doors must be closed.

88
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,567
- Close the doors.
- Yes, sir.

89
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:20,823
R2 says the chances of survival are 725-to-1.

90
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:36,130
Actually, R2 has been known
to make mistakes...

91
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,843
from time to time.

92
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,803
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

93
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,392
Don't worry about Master Luke.
I'm sure he'll be all right.

94
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:51,354
He's quite clever, you know,
for a human being.

95
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,163
Luke.

96
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,333
Luke.

97
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,342
Ben?

98
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,095
You will go to the Dagobah system.

99
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,971
Dagobah system?

100
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:29,558
There you will learn from Yoda...

101
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:33,437
the Jedi master who instructed me.

102
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:55,292
Don't do this, Luke. Give me a sign here.

103
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:21,318
- Not much time.
- Ben.

104
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:28,993
Hang on, kid.

105
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,330
Dagobah system. Dagobah.

106
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,124
This may smell bad, kid...

107
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:38,419
Yoda.

108
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:43,007
but it'll keep you warm
till I get the shelter up.

109
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,176
Ben. Dagobah.

110
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,098
I thought they smelled bad...

111
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:53,100
on the outside.

112
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,813
Echo Base, I've got something.

113
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,856
Not much, but it could be a life-form.

114
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,738
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?

115
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:49,740
This is Rogue Two.

116
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:52,535
This is Rogue Two.

117
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,538
Captain Solo, do you copy?

118
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,672
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?

119
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,632
This is Rogue Two.

120
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,885
Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by.

121
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,848
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.

122
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,559
I've found them. Repeat. I've found them.

123
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,009
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

124
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:53,345
- Thanks, 3PO.
- R2 expresses his relief also.

125
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,974
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.

126
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,977
You look strong enough
to pull the ears off a gundark.

127
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:03,898
- Thanks to you.
- That's two you owe me, junior.

128
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,357
Well, Your Worship...

129
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:08,569
looks like you managed to keep me around
for a little while longer.

130
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,571
I had nothing to do with it.

131
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,324
General Rieekan thinks
it's dangerous for any ships to leave...

132
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,367
until we've activated the energy field.

133
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:16,744
That's a good story.

134
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:20,789
I think you just can't bear to let a
gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.

135
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:24,251
I don't know where
you get your delusions, laser brain.

136
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,882
Laugh it up, fuzzball...

137
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:33,093
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.

138
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,471
She expressed her true feelings for me.

139
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,722
My...

140
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:40,267
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted...

141
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:42,478
scruffy-looking nerf herder!

142
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,648
Who's scruffy-lookin'?

143
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:52,363
I must have hit close to the mark
to get her riled up like that, huh, kid?

144
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,953
I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

145
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,878
Headquarters personnel,
report to command center.

146
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,759
Headquarters personnel,
report to command center.

147
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,844
Take it easy.

148
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,013
Excuse us, please.

149
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,351
Princess, we have a visitor.

150
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:26,397
We picked up something
outside Zone 12 moving east.

151
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,774
- It's metal.
- It couldn't be one of those creatures.

152
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,695
- Could be one of our speeders.
- No. Wait.

153
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,489
There's something very weak coming through.

154
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,829
Sir, I am fluent in six million
forms of communication.

155
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:45,082
This signal is not used by the Alliance.
It could be an imperial code.

156
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,132
It isn't friendly. Chewie, let's check it out.

157
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:56,260
Send Rogues 10 and 11 to Station 38.

158
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:34,506
- I'm afraid there's not much left.
- What was it?

159
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,675
Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard.

160
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,262
- Must have had a self-destruct.
- An imperial probe droid.

161
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,265
It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.

162
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,267
We'd better start the evacuation.

163
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,107
- Admiral.
- Yes, Captain?

164
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:37,402
I think we've got something, sir.
The report is only a fragment...

165
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:40,405
from a probe droid in the Hoth system,
but it's the best lead we've had.

166
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,617
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.

167
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,703
- I want proof, not leads.
- The visuals indicate life readings.

168
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:49,081
It could mean anything.
If we followed up every lead...

169
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:52,251
But, sir, the Hoth system is
supposed to be devoid of human forms.

170
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,795
- You found something?
- Yes, my lord.

171
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,508
That's it. The rebels are there.

172
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:04,096
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

173
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,974
- It could be smugglers...
- That is the system.

174
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,476
And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.

175
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:12,604
Set your course for the Hoth system.

176
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:15,149
General Veers, prepare your men.

177
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,608
Admiral.

178
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,492
Groups Seven and 10
will stay behind to fly the speeders.

179
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:27,452
As soon as each transport is loaded...

180
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:29,621
evacuation control
will give clearance for launch.

181
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,415
Right, sir.

182
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,627
All right. That's it.

183
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,212
Try it.

184
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,717
Turn it off! Turn it off!

185
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:47,472
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47s.

186
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:51,226
Forget the heavy equipment. There's time
to get small modules on the transports.

187
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,395
- Take care, sir.
- Thanks.

188
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,943
Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?

189
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,324
Okay, okay.

190
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,243
Hi, kid.

191
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:11,455
There's gotta be a reason for it.
Check it at the other end.

192
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:12,998
Wait a second.

193
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,501
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

194
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,885
Be careful.

195
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,887
You too.

196
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:34,853
General, there's a fleet of Stardestroyers...

197
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,231
coming out of hyperspace in Sector Four.

198
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:40,317
Reroute all power to the energy shield.

199
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:43,528
We gotta hold them till
all transports are away.

200
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:45,697
Prepare for ground assault.

201
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,923
- What is it, General?
- The fleet has moved out of light speed.

202
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,133
ComScan has detected an energy field...

203
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:07,844
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.

204
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,430
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

205
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:13,016
The rebels are alerted to our presence.

206
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:16,228
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

207
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,605
He felt surprise was wiser.

208
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,816
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.

209
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,528
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

210
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,280
Yes, my lord.

211
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:34,371
Lord Vader.

212
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:37,499
The fleet has moved out of light speed,
and we're preparing to...

213
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:42,713
You have failed me for the last time, Admiral.

214
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:45,215
- Captain Piett.
- Yes, my lord?

215
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,343
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field...

216
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:51,430
and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.

217
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:54,725
You are in command now, Admiral Piett.

218
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,685
Thank you, Lord Vader.

219
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:01,356
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

220
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:04,151
The heavy transport ships
will leave as soon as they're loaded.

221
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,320
Only two fighter escorts per ship.

222
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:09,531
The energy shield
can only be opened for a short time...

223
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,159
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.

224
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:14,369
Two fighters against a Stardestroyer?

225
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,538
The ion cannon will fire several shots...

226
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,791
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

227
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:22,002
When you've gotten past the energy shield...

228
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,171
proceed directly to the rendezvous point.

229
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:26,214
Understood?

230
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,924
Good luck.

231
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:30,552
Everybody to your stations. Let's go.

232
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:50,739
Their primary target will be
the power generators.

233
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,741
Prepare to open shield.

234
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,707
Sir, rebel ships are coming into our sector.

235
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:02,918
Good. Our first catch of the day.

236
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:07,005
Stand by, ion control.

237
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,091
Fire.

238
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,401
The first transport is away.

239
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:30,278
The first transport is away.

240
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,662
Feeling all right, sir?

241
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,664
Just like new, Dak. How about you?

242
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,708
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

243
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:45,919
I know what you mean.

244
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:07,524
Echo Station 3-T8.
We've spotted imperial walkers.

245
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:10,110
Imperial walkers on the north ridge.

246
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:34,509
Echo Station 57, we're on our way.

247
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:41,933
All right, boys, keep tight now.

248
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:44,186
Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set.

249
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,770
Steady, Dak.

250
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,731
Attack pattern Delta. Go now.

251
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,195
I'm coming in.

252
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:58,742
Hobbie, you still with me?

253
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:23,600
That armor's too strong for blasters.

254
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,230
Rogue Group, use your harpoons and tow cables.

255
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,565
Go for the legs. It might be our only chance.

256
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,152
Stand by, Dak.

257
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:37,072
Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control.

258
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,199
I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.

259
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,201
Just hang on.

260
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:44,120
Hang on, Dak.
Get ready to fire that tow cable.

261
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:50,544
Dak?

262
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,571
Yes, Lord Vader.
I've reached the main power generators.

263
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:20,782
The shield will be down in moments.
You may start your landing.

264
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:26,955
Rogue Three.

265
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,498
Copy, Rogue Leader.

266
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:31,585
Wedge, I've lost my gunner.
You'll have to make this shot.

267
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:33,420
I'll cover for you.

268
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:35,922
Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass.

269
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:39,092
Coming around, Rogue Leader.

270
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,430
Steady, Rogue Two.

271
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,473
Activate harpoon.

272
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:49,978
Good shot, Jansen.

273
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:58,320
One more pass.

274
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:06,119
Cable out. Let her go!

275
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:07,495
Detach cable.

276
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:09,331
Cable detached.

277
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,840
Come on!

278
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:29,267
- That got him!
- I see it, Wedge. Good work.

279
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,853
I don't think we can protect
two transports at a time.

280
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,272
It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer.

281
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:36,024
We have no choice.

282
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,694
- Launch patrol.
- Evacuate remaining ground staff.

283
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:48,078
This one goes there,
that one goes there. Right?

284
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:51,665
R2, you take good care
of Master Luke now, understand?

285
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,669
And do take good care of yourself.

286
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,882
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

287
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,991
All troops will debark for ground assault.

288
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:29,577
Prepare to target the main generator.

289
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:36,710
- Rogue Two, are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

290
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:38,712
Set harpoon. I'll cover for you.

291
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:43,216
- Coming around.
- Watch that cross fire, boys.

292
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,428
Set for position three.

293
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:47,846
Steady.

294
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,473
Stay tight and low. This is it!

295
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,605
Hobbie!

296
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,232
I've been hit!

297
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:44,611
- You all right?
- Why are you still here?

298
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:47,739
- Heard the command center had been hit.
- You've got your clearance to leave.

299
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:51,284
Don't worry. I'll leave.
First I'm gonna get you to your ship.

300
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:54,496
Your Highness, we must take
this last transport. It's our only hope.

301
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,707
Send all troops in Sector 12 to
the south slope to protect the fighters.

302
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:01,419
Imperial troops have entered the base.

303
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:03,171
Imperial troops have entered...

304
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,173
Come on. That's it.

305
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,675
Give the evacuation code signal.

306
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:11,596
And get to your transports.

307
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,847
Wait for me.

308
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,432
Begin retreat!

309
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:17,352
Fall back!

310
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:18,413
- Distance to power generators?
- 17.28.

311
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:29,424
Target. Maximum firepower.

312
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:58,369
Transport, this is Solo.
Take off. I can't get to you.

313
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:00,455
I'll get her out on the Falcon. Come on.

314
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,126
Where are you going? Come back!

315
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:26,981
Wait! Wait for me! Stop!

316
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:28,983
- How typical.
- Come on.

317
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,698
Hurry up, goldenrod!
You're gonna be a permanent resident.

318
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:37,659
Wait! Wait!

319
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:58,763
- How's this?
- Would it help if I got out and pushed?

320
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:01,099
- Captain Solo. Captain Solo.
- It might.

321
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:05,061
Sir, might I suggest that you...

322
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,854
It can wait.

323
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,611
This bucket of bolts
will never get past that blockade.

324
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:15,822
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.

325
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:26,749
Come on! Come on!

326
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:29,877
Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

327
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,547
See?

328
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,008
Someday you'll be wrong.
I hope I'm there to see it.

329
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,012
Punch it!

330
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:58,072
R2.

331
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,784
Get her ready for takeoff.

332
00:36:04,038 --> 00:36:06,247
Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous.

333
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:12,170
Don't worry, R2. We're going. We're going.

334
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:27,935
There's nothing wrong, R2.
I'm just setting a new course.

335
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:35,568
We're not gonna regroup with the others.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

336
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,405
Yes, R2.

337
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:45,286
That's all right. I'd like to keep it
on manual control for a while.

338
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:04,347
- I saw 'em! I saw 'em!
- Saw what?

339
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,641
Stardestroyers, two of 'em coming right at us.

340
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,602
- Sir, might I suggest...
- Shut him up or shut him down!

341
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:13,397
Check the deflector shield.

342
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,485
Great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them.

343
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:23,783
Take evasive action!

344
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:38,172
- Prepare to jump to light speed.
- But, sir!

345
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:40,842
They're getting closer.

346
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:43,136
Oh, yeah? Watch this.

347
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,807
Watch what?

348
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:51,894
- I think we're in trouble.
- If I may say so...

349
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:54,480
I noticed earlier the hyperdrive
motivator has been damaged.

350
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:57,692
- It's impossible to go to light speed.
- We're in trouble.

351
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,239
Horizontal boosters!

352
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,493
Alluvial dampers.

353
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:12,957
That's not it. Bring me the hydrospanner.

354
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,130
I don't know how
we're gonna get out of this one.

355
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,050
Chewie!

356
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,764
That wasn't a laser blast. Something hit us.

357
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:30,349
Han, get up here.

358
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:33,477
Come on, Chewie!

359
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:35,354
Asteroids.

360
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,903
- Chewie, set 271.
- What are you doing?

361
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:45,573
You're not actually going
into an asteroid field?

362
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,450
They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?

363
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:52,580
You don't have to do this to impress me.

364
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,875
Sir, the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field...

365
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:59,253
- is approximately 3,720-to-1.
- Never tell me the odds.

366
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:30,368
You said you wanted to be around when
I made a mistake. This could be it.

367
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:32,119
I take it back.

368
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:35,331
We're gonna get pulverized
if we stay out here much longer.

369
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,250
- Ain't gonna argue with that.
- Pulverized?

370
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:39,210
I'm going closer to one of the big ones.

371
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,170
- Closer?
- Closer?

372
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,157
This is suicide! There's nowhere to go.

373
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:12,243
There. That looks pretty good.

374
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,245
What looks pretty good?

375
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,747
Yeah. That'll do nicely.

376
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:19,709
Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?

377
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:31,887
I hope you know what you're doing.

378
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:33,472
Yeah. Me too.

379
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:44,525
Yep, that's it. Dagobah.

380
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:49,196
No, I'm not gonna change my mind about this.

381
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:52,575
I'm not picking up any cities or technology.

382
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,744
Massive life-form readings though.

383
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,872
There's something alive down there.

384
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:02,418
Yes. I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.

385
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:11,844
I know! I know!

386
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:14,638
All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing.

387
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:17,850
Just hang on.
I'm gonna start the landing cycle.

388
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:14,615
No, R2, you stay put. I'll have a look around.

389
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,287
R2?

390
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,418
Where are you?

391
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,339
R2!

392
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,806
You be more careful.

393
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:44,645
R2, that way.

394
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,008
R2!

395
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,162
Oh, no.

396
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:46,457
Are you all right? Come on.

397
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,046
You were lucky to get out of there.

398
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,090
Anything broken?

399
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:00,930
If you're saying coming here was a bad idea...

400
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:03,224
I'm beginning to agree with ya.

401
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:06,018
R2, what are we doing here?

402
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,561
It's like...

403
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:10,689
something out of a dream or...

404
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:13,692
I don't know.

405
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:15,861
Maybe I'm just going crazy.

406
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,603
Yes, Admiral?

407
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:51,814
Our ships have sighted
the Millennium Falcon, lord...

408
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:55,025
but it has entered an asteroid field,
and we cannot risk...

409
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,945
Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral.

410
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:01,615
- I want that ship, not excuses.
- Yes, lord.

411
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:10,833
I'm gonna shut down everything
but the emergency power systems.

412
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:14,920
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does
that include shutting me down too?

413
00:45:15,005 --> 00:45:17,089
No. I need you to talk to the Falcon...

414
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:19,466
find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.

415
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:30,811
Sir, it's quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable.

416
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,813
Not entirely stable?

417
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:34,982
I'm glad you're here to tell us these things.

418
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:38,694
Chewie, take the professor in the back
and plug him into the hyperdrive.

419
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:41,322
Sometimes I just don't
understand human behavior.

420
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:43,782
After all, I'm only trying to do my job.

421
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,289
Let go.

422
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,418
- Let go, please.
- Don't get excited.

423
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:58,255
Captain, being held by you
isn't quite enough to get me excited.

424
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,215
Sorry, sweetheart.

425
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,010
I haven't got time for anything else.

426
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,881
Ready for some power? Okay.

427
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,303
Let's see now.

428
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:48,722
Put that in there. There you go.

429
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,603
Now all I gotta do is find this Yoda...

430
00:46:54,688 --> 00:46:57,064
if he even exists.

431
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:05,447
It's really a strange place
to find a Jedi master.

432
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:08,742
This place gives me the creeps.

433
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:14,081
Still...

434
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,418
there's something familiar about this place.

435
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,422
I don't know.

436
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,590
- I feel like...
- Feel like what?

437
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:26,301
Like we're being watched.

438
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:29,430
Away put your weapon. I mean you no harm.

439
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,392
I am wondering, why are you here?

440
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:38,063
- I'm looking for someone.
- Looking?

441
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:40,816
Found someone you have, I would say.

442
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:43,610
Right.

443
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:46,947
Help you I can. Yes.

444
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:48,991
I don't think so.

445
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:53,328
I'm looking for a great warrior.

446
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:55,080
Great warrior.

447
00:47:58,126 --> 00:48:00,419
Wars not make one great.

448
00:48:08,762 --> 00:48:10,512
Put that down.

449
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:12,598
Hey! That's my dinner.

450
00:48:15,852 --> 00:48:18,604
How you get so big eating food of this kind?

451
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:20,939
Listen, friend, we didn't mean
to land in that puddle.

452
00:48:21,024 --> 00:48:23,609
If we could get our ship out, we would.
But we can't.

453
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:25,819
Aw, cannot get your ship out.

454
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:27,613
Get out of there.

455
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:33,160
Hey, you could have broken this.

456
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:36,830
Don't do that.

457
00:48:45,882 --> 00:48:47,966
You're making a mess.

458
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:51,512
Hey, give me that.

459
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:54,181
Mine, or I will help you not.

460
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,308
I don't want your help. I want my lamp back.

461
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:58,644
I'm gonna need it to get out of
this slimy mudhole.

462
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:01,480
Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is.

463
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:06,735
R2, let him have it.

464
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:12,157
- Mine! Mine! Mine!
- R2.

465
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:19,456
Will you move along, little fella?
We got a lot of work to do.

466
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,752
Stay and help you I will. Find your friend.

467
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:27,548
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi master.

468
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:32,010
Jedi master. Yoda.

469
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:34,721
- You seek Yoda.
- You know him?

470
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,559
Take you to him I will.

471
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:42,938
Yes, yes, but now we must eat.

472
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:45,732
Come. Good food. Come.

473
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,160
Come, come.

474
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:00,455
R2...

475
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:03,584
stay and watch after the camp.

476
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:19,182
Where is R2 when I need him?

477
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:21,977
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate...

478
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:24,021
but it has the most peculiar dialect.

479
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:27,649
I believe it says the power coupling
on the negative axis has been polarized.

480
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:30,235
I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.

481
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:33,614
Well, of course I'll have to replace it.

482
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:37,075
Here. And, Chewie...

483
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:41,413
I think we better replace
the negative power coupling.

484
00:51:03,645 --> 00:51:06,438
Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.

485
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:09,024
Would you please stop calling me that?

486
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:11,109
Sure, Leia.

487
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:14,655
- You make it so difficult sometimes.
- I do. I really do.

488
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:17,991
You could be a little nicer though.

489
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:20,786
Admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.

490
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:25,415
Occasionally, maybe...

491
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,001
when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.

492
00:51:28,086 --> 00:51:29,544
Scoundrel?

493
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:35,217
I like the sound of that.

494
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,096
- Stop that.
- Stop what?

495
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,390
Stop that. My hands are dirty.

496
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:43,684
My hands are dirty too.
What are you afraid of?

497
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:45,978
- Afraid?
- You're trembling.

498
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,981
I'm not trembling.

499
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,901
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.

500
00:51:52,986 --> 00:51:55,445
There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.

501
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,614
I happen to like nice men.

502
00:51:57,699 --> 00:52:00,409
- I'm a nice man.
- No, you're not.

503
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:04,329
Sir, sir!

504
00:52:04,414 --> 00:52:07,332
I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.

505
00:52:09,544 --> 00:52:10,794
Thank you.

506
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:13,880
- Thank you very much.
- You're perfectly welcome, sir.

507
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:23,098
That, Lord Vader, was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes.

508
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:26,143
Considering the damage we've sustained,
they must have been destroyed.

509
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:29,563
No, Captain, they're alive.

510
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:34,067
I want every ship available to sweep
the asteroid field until they are found.

511
00:52:38,531 --> 00:52:41,867
- Lord Vader.
- Yes, Admiral. What is it?

512
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:44,244
The emperor commands you
to make contact with him.

513
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:46,538
Move the ship out of the asteroid field...

514
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:48,915
so that we can send a clear transmission.

515
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,667
Yes, my lord.

516
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:09,811
What is thy bidding, my master?

517
00:53:11,064 --> 00:53:15,150
There is a great disturbance in the Force.

518
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:18,361
I have felt it.

519
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:21,031
We have a new enemy...

520
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:25,160
the young rebel who destroyed the Death Star.

521
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:28,413
I have no doubt this boy...

522
00:53:28,498 --> 00:53:32,918
is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.

523
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:35,295
How is that possible?

524
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:38,799
Search your feelings, Lord Vader.

525
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:42,135
You will know it to be true.

526
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:44,721
He could destroy us.

527
00:53:44,806 --> 00:53:46,932
He's just a boy.

528
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:49,518
Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

529
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:53,230
The Force is strong with him.

530
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:59,528
The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.

531
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:01,822
If he could be turned...

532
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:04,825
he would become a powerful ally.

533
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:07,536
Yes.

534
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:12,666
He would be a great asset.

535
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,043
Can it be done?

536
00:54:15,128 --> 00:54:19,131
He will join us or die, master.

537
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:39,693
I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't
understand why we can't see Yoda now.

538
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:43,613
Patience. For the Jedi,
it is time to eat as well.

539
00:54:46,993 --> 00:54:48,994
Eat. Eat.

540
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:51,204
Hot.

541
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:00,922
Good food. Good.

542
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:03,967
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

543
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:06,344
Not far. Yoda not far.

544
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:09,222
Patience. Soon you will be with him.

545
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:14,311
Root leaf. I cook.

546
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:18,607
Why wish you become Jedi?

547
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,360
Mostly 'cause of my father, I guess.

548
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:25,572
Father. Powerful Jedi was he.

549
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:28,867
- Powerful Jedi.
- Oh, come on.

550
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,454
How could you know my father?
You don't even know who I am.

551
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:36,082
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
We're wasting our time!

552
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,794
I cannot teach him.

553
00:55:39,879 --> 00:55:41,963
The boy has no patience.

554
00:55:42,048 --> 00:55:44,341
He will learn patience.

555
00:55:49,138 --> 00:55:51,556
Much anger in him...

556
00:55:51,641 --> 00:55:53,516
like his father.

557
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:57,395
Was I any different when you taught me?

558
00:55:58,689 --> 00:55:59,689
No.

559
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:03,902
- He is not ready.
- Yoda.

560
00:56:06,948 --> 00:56:08,823
I am ready.

561
00:56:08,908 --> 00:56:11,868
I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm...

562
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:15,830
Ready, are you? What know you ready?

563
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:19,918
For 800 years have I trained Jedi.

564
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:23,797
My own counsel will I keep
on who is to be trained.

565
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:29,552
A Jedi must have the deepest commitment...

566
00:56:29,637 --> 00:56:31,513
the most serious mind.

567
00:56:33,474 --> 00:56:36,601
This one a long time have I watched.

568
00:56:37,645 --> 00:56:40,438
All his life has he looked away...

569
00:56:40,523 --> 00:56:43,608
to the future, to the horizon.

570
00:56:43,693 --> 00:56:47,320
Never his mind on where he was...

571
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,657
what he was doing.

572
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:53,368
Adventure.

573
00:56:54,704 --> 00:56:56,371
Excitement.

574
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:58,790
A Jedi craves not these things.

575
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:01,501
You are reckless.

576
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:04,587
So was I, if you remember.

577
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:06,756
He is too old.

578
00:57:08,718 --> 00:57:10,927
Yes, too old to begin the training.

579
00:57:11,012 --> 00:57:13,013
But I've learned so much.

580
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:24,065
- Will he finish what he begins?
- I won't fail you.

581
00:57:25,568 --> 00:57:27,277
I'm not afraid.

582
00:57:31,741 --> 00:57:33,825
You will be.

583
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:37,037
You will be.

584
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,624
- Sir, if I may venture an opinion...
- I'm not interested in your opinion.

585
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,751
There's something out there.

586
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,878
- Where?
- Outside in the cave.

587
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:30,048
There it is. Listen!

588
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:32,050
- I'm going out there.
- Are you crazy?

589
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:34,719
I just got this bucket together.
I won't let it get torn apart.

590
00:58:34,804 --> 00:58:36,971
Then I'm going with you.

591
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:41,309
I think it might be better
if I stay behind and guard the ship.

592
00:58:41,394 --> 00:58:42,435
Oh, no.

593
00:58:57,493 --> 00:58:59,577
This ground sure feels strange.

594
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:03,248
It doesn't feel like rock.

595
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:10,338
There's an awful lot of moisture in here.

596
00:59:10,423 --> 00:59:14,175
I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.

597
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,510
Yeah.

598
00:59:17,555 --> 00:59:18,513
Watch out!

599
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:22,100
It's all right. It's all right.

600
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:24,686
Yeah, that's what I thought... mynock.

601
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:27,939
Chewie, check the rest of the ship and
make sure there are no more attached...

602
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:29,941
chewing on the power cables.

603
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:31,651
Mynocks?

604
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:33,987
Go inside. We'll clean them off
if there are any more.

605
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:45,665
Go away! Go away, beastly thing! Shoo!

606
00:59:52,882 --> 00:59:54,757
Wait a minute.

607
01:00:16,447 --> 01:00:19,908
- Chewie, let's get out of here!
- The Empire is still out there!

608
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:22,076
No time to discuss this in committee!

609
01:00:22,912 --> 01:00:24,996
I am not a committee!

610
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:33,296
You can't make the jump to light speed
in this asteroid field.

611
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,882
Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off.

612
01:00:40,638 --> 01:00:42,013
- Look!
- I see it.

613
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:44,516
- We're doomed!
- The cave is collapsing.

614
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,559
- This is no cave.
- What?

615
01:01:18,968 --> 01:01:20,385
Yes, run.

616
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:22,053
Yes.

617
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:25,515
A Jedi's strength flows from the Force.

618
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:29,060
But beware of the dark side.
Anger, fear, aggression...

619
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:31,354
The dark side of the Force are they.

620
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:35,066
Easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.

621
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,402
If once you start down the dark path...

622
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:39,821
forever will it dominate your destiny.

623
01:01:39,905 --> 01:01:43,908
Consume you it will,
as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.

624
01:01:43,993 --> 01:01:45,868
Vader.

625
01:01:45,953 --> 01:01:49,080
- Is the dark side stronger?
- No, no.

626
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:52,792
Quicker, easier, more seductive.

627
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:55,753
How am I to know the good side from the bad?

628
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:58,131
You will know...

629
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:00,508
when you are calm, at peace...

630
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:03,011
passive.

631
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:08,266
A Jedi uses the Force
for knowledge and defense...

632
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:10,226
never for attack.

633
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:13,980
- But tell me why I can't...
- No. There is no why.

634
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:16,858
Nothing more will I teach you today.

635
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:18,985
Clear your mind of questions.

636
01:02:42,009 --> 01:02:44,010
There's something not right here.

637
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:49,349
I feel cold.

638
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:51,726
- Death.
- That place...

639
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:56,356
is strong with the dark side of the Force.

640
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,399
A domain of evil it is.

641
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:01,819
In you must go.

642
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:04,197
What's in there?

643
01:03:06,784 --> 01:03:09,243
Only what you take with you.

644
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:14,248
Your weapons...

645
01:03:15,084 --> 01:03:16,584
you will not need them.

646
01:05:56,662 --> 01:05:59,121
Bounty hunters. We don't need their scum.

647
01:05:59,206 --> 01:06:02,208
- Yes, sir.
- Those rebels won't escape us.

648
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,175
Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Stardestroyer Avenger.

649
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:12,844
Right.

650
01:06:12,928 --> 01:06:18,766
There will be a substantial reward for
the one who finds the Millennium Falcon.

651
01:06:18,851 --> 01:06:21,936
You are free to use any methods necessary...

652
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,188
but I want them alive.

653
01:06:24,273 --> 01:06:26,732
No disintegrations.

654
01:06:26,817 --> 01:06:28,734
- As you wish.
- Lord Vader.

655
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:32,905
My lord, we have them.

656
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:40,454
Thank goodness
we're coming out of the asteroid field.

657
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:48,170
Let's get out of here. Ready for light speed?

658
01:06:48,255 --> 01:06:50,631
One, two...

659
01:06:50,716 --> 01:06:51,883
three!

660
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:00,766
It's not fair.

661
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:05,146
Transfer circuits aren't working.
It's not my fault.

662
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:08,232
- No light speed?
- It's not my fault.

663
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,989
Sir, we just lost
the main rear deflector shield.

664
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:17,366
One more direct hit
on the back quarter and we're done for.

665
01:07:17,451 --> 01:07:19,201
Turn her around.

666
01:07:19,286 --> 01:07:21,954
Turn her around! I'm gonna
put all power in the front shield.

667
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:24,081
- You're gonna attack?
- The odds of surviving...

668
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:26,125
a direct assault
on an imperial Stardestroyer...

669
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:28,169
Shut up!

670
01:07:34,635 --> 01:07:36,636
They're moving to attack position.

671
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:39,972
Shields up.

672
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,397
Track them. They may
come around for another pass.

673
01:07:48,482 --> 01:07:51,442
Captain Needa, the ship no longer
appears on our scopes.

674
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:55,363
They can't have disappeared. No ship
that small has a cloaking device.

675
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:59,325
- There's no trace of them.
- Captain, Lord Vader demands an update.

676
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,372
Get a shuttle ready.

677
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:08,417
I shall assume full responsibility for
losing them and apologize to Lord Vader.

678
01:08:08,502 --> 01:08:11,629
- Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.
- Yes, Captain Needa.

679
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:18,594
Use the Force.

680
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:19,720
Yes.

681
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:27,103
Now, the stone.

682
01:08:31,233 --> 01:08:32,900
Feel it.

683
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:46,414
Concentrate!

684
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:04,140
Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.

685
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:06,017
So certain are you.

686
01:09:10,022 --> 01:09:13,274
Always with you it cannot be done.

687
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:16,485
Hear you nothing that I say?

688
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:18,696
Master, moving stones around is one thing.

689
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,656
This is totally different.

690
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:23,034
No. No different.

691
01:09:23,118 --> 01:09:25,244
Only different in your mind.

692
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:28,581
You must unlearn what you have learned.

693
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:33,085
- All right. I'll give it a try.
- Try not.

694
01:09:33,879 --> 01:09:35,337
Do...

695
01:09:35,422 --> 01:09:37,048
or do not.

696
01:09:37,132 --> 01:09:38,883
There is no try.

697
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:30,392
I can't. It's too big.

698
01:10:30,477 --> 01:10:32,561
Size matters not.

699
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:35,689
Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you?

700
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:41,320
And well you should not...

701
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:44,073
for my ally is the Force.

702
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:46,575
And a powerful ally it is.

703
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:50,037
Life creates it...

704
01:10:50,122 --> 01:10:52,206
makes it grow.

705
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:55,876
Its energy surrounds us...

706
01:10:56,878 --> 01:10:58,712
and binds us.

707
01:10:58,797 --> 01:11:02,049
Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter.

708
01:11:03,093 --> 01:11:06,387
You must feel the Force around you.

709
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:09,849
Here, between you, me...

710
01:11:10,517 --> 01:11:14,520
the tree, the rock... everywhere.

711
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:16,605
Yes...

712
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:20,693
even between the land and the ship.

713
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:27,825
You want the impossible.

714
01:13:15,183 --> 01:13:17,434
I don't believe it.

715
01:13:19,187 --> 01:13:22,064
That is why you fail.

716
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:44,586
Apology accepted, Captain Needa.

717
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:56,140
Lord Vader, our ships have completed
their scan and found nothing.

718
01:13:56,224 --> 01:13:58,225
If the Millennium Falcon
went into light speed...

719
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:00,269
it'll be on the other side of the galaxy now.

720
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:02,104
Alert all commands.

721
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:06,608
Calculate every possible destination
along their last known trajectory.

722
01:14:06,693 --> 01:14:10,154
- Yes, my lord. We'll find them.
- Don't fail me again...

723
01:14:11,031 --> 01:14:13,073
Admiral.

724
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:18,537
Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.

725
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:36,722
Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far.

726
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:39,933
I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

727
01:14:40,018 --> 01:14:42,102
The fleet's beginning to break up.

728
01:14:42,187 --> 01:14:45,105
Go stand by the manual release
for the landing claw.

729
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,443
I really don't see how that's going to help.

730
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:53,030
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable
alternative in extreme circumstances.

731
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:55,240
The Empire may be gracious enough...

732
01:14:55,325 --> 01:14:57,785
- Thank you.
- What did you have in mind next?

733
01:14:57,869 --> 01:14:59,828
If they follow standard imperial procedure...

734
01:14:59,913 --> 01:15:02,122
they'll dump their garbage
before they go to light speed.

735
01:15:02,207 --> 01:15:05,334
- Then we just float away.
- With the rest of the garbage.

736
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:06,877
Then what?

737
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:10,255
Then we gotta find a safe port
somewhere around here.

738
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,757
Any ideas?

739
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:14,259
- Where are we?
- The Anoat system.

740
01:15:14,344 --> 01:15:16,970
The Anoat system. There's not much there.

741
01:15:17,055 --> 01:15:19,932
Oh, wait. This is interesting.

742
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:22,935
- Lando.
- Lando system?

743
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:26,647
Lando's not a system.
He's a man. Lando Calrissian.

744
01:15:26,731 --> 01:15:29,024
Cardplayer, gambler.

745
01:15:29,109 --> 01:15:31,735
- A scoundrel. You'd like him.
- Thanks.

746
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:34,530
Bespin. It's pretty far,
but I think we can make it.

747
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:39,076
- A mining colony?
- Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.

748
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:42,079
Lando conned somebody out of it.

749
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:44,915
We go back a long way, Lando and me.

750
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:49,002
- Can you trust him?
- No.

751
01:15:49,087 --> 01:15:52,005
But he's got no love for the Empire.
I can tell you that.

752
01:15:52,841 --> 01:15:55,759
Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach.

753
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:04,476
You do have your moments.

754
01:16:05,145 --> 01:16:08,105
Not many of them, but you do have them.

755
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:44,892
Concentrate.

756
01:16:44,976 --> 01:16:48,228
Feel the Force flow.

757
01:16:48,313 --> 01:16:50,022
Yes.

758
01:16:57,614 --> 01:16:59,323
Good.

759
01:16:59,407 --> 01:17:00,824
Calm.

760
01:17:00,909 --> 01:17:02,326
Yes.

761
01:17:02,994 --> 01:17:05,787
Through the Force, things you will see.

762
01:17:05,872 --> 01:17:09,374
Other places. The future. The past.

763
01:17:09,459 --> 01:17:11,919
Old friends long gone.

764
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:23,889
Control, control.

765
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,225
You must learn control.

766
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:32,231
I saw a city in the clouds.

767
01:17:34,234 --> 01:17:36,443
Friends you have there.

768
01:17:37,487 --> 01:17:41,198
- They were in pain.
- It is the future you see.

769
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:43,408
Future?

770
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:53,794
Will they die?

771
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:59,132
Difficult to see.

772
01:17:59,217 --> 01:18:01,760
Always in motion is the future.

773
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:05,639
I've gotta go to them.

774
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:10,686
Decide you must how to serve them best.

775
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:13,689
If you leave now, help them you could...

776
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:18,318
but you would destroy all
for which they have fought and suffered.

777
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,168
No, I don't have a landing permit.

778
01:18:35,253 --> 01:18:38,922
I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.

779
01:18:39,007 --> 01:18:41,174
Wait a minute! Let me explain!

780
01:18:41,259 --> 01:18:43,260
You will not deviate from your present course.

781
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:46,138
- Rather touchy, aren't they?
- I thought you knew this person.

782
01:18:48,975 --> 01:18:51,810
That was a long time ago.
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.

783
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:04,031
Permission granted to land on Platform 327.

784
01:19:04,115 --> 01:19:05,532
Thank you.

785
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:09,328
Nothing to worry about.
We go way back, Lando and me.

786
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:11,163
Who's worried?

787
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:01,380
No one to meet us.

788
01:20:02,757 --> 01:20:05,133
I don't like this.

789
01:20:05,218 --> 01:20:08,095
- What would you like?
- They did let us land.

790
01:20:08,179 --> 01:20:10,931
Look, don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine.

791
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:12,724
Trust me.

792
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:19,481
See? My friend.

793
01:20:23,695 --> 01:20:25,946
Keep your eyes open.

794
01:20:28,408 --> 01:20:30,283
Hey.

795
01:20:30,368 --> 01:20:34,496
Why, you slimy, double-crossing,
no-good swindler.

796
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:38,875
You've got a lot of guts coming here,
after what you pulled.

797
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:52,806
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!

798
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:55,976
- I never thought I'd see you again.
- Well, he seems very friendly.

799
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:59,187
Yes. Very friendly.

800
01:20:59,272 --> 01:21:00,939
What are you doing here?

801
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:03,066
Repairs. I thought you could help me out.

802
01:21:03,151 --> 01:21:05,819
- What have you done to my ship?
- Your ship?

803
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:09,489
Hey, remember,
you lost her to me fair and square.

804
01:21:10,324 --> 01:21:11,783
How you doin', Chewbacca?

805
01:21:12,452 --> 01:21:15,412
Still hanging around with this loser?

806
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:19,750
Hello. What have we here?

807
01:21:20,668 --> 01:21:24,588
Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian.
I'm the administrator of this facility.

808
01:21:24,672 --> 01:21:27,799
- And who might you be?
- Leia.

809
01:21:27,884 --> 01:21:29,551
Welcome, Leia.

810
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:35,223
All right, all right. You old smoothie.

811
01:21:35,308 --> 01:21:38,685
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

812
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:41,897
My facilities are at your... Well, really!

813
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:44,399
- What's wrong with the Falcon?
- Hyperdrive.

814
01:21:44,484 --> 01:21:46,568
- I'll get my people to work on her.
- Good.

815
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:48,737
That ship saved my life quite a few times.

816
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:51,406
She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.

817
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:55,202
How's the gas mine? Still paying off for you?

818
01:21:55,286 --> 01:21:59,164
Not as well as I'd like. We're a small
outpost and not very self-sufficient.

819
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:02,375
I've had supply problems of every kind.

820
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:04,669
I've had labor difficulties.

821
01:22:04,754 --> 01:22:08,048
- What's so funny?
- You. Listen to you.

822
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:10,967
You sound like a businessman,
a responsible leader.

823
01:22:11,052 --> 01:22:12,969
Who'd have thought that, huh?

824
01:22:13,054 --> 01:22:16,014
Seeing you sure brings back a few things.

825
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:17,349
Yeah.

826
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:19,601
Yeah, I'm responsible these days.

827
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:23,146
It's the price you pay for being successful.

828
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:28,443
Nice to see a familiar face.

829
01:22:28,528 --> 01:22:30,195
How rude!

830
01:22:31,739 --> 01:22:33,824
That sounds like an R2 unit in there.

831
01:22:33,908 --> 01:22:35,534
I wonder if... Hello?

832
01:22:37,745 --> 01:22:39,329
How interesting.

833
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:42,541
- Who are you?
- Oh, my. I'm terribly sorry.

834
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,709
I didn't mean to intrude. Please don't get up.

835
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:05,772
Luke, you must complete the training.

836
01:23:06,816 --> 01:23:09,651
I can't keep the vision out of my head.
I've gotta help them.

837
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:11,903
You must not go.

838
01:23:11,988 --> 01:23:15,115
- But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
- You don't know that.

839
01:23:17,952 --> 01:23:20,787
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

840
01:23:20,872 --> 01:23:23,665
But I can help them. I feel the Force.

841
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:25,959
But you cannot control it.

842
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:28,503
This is a dangerous time for you...

843
01:23:28,588 --> 01:23:31,631
when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.

844
01:23:31,716 --> 01:23:34,968
Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen.

845
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:37,262
The cave.

846
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:39,472
Remember your failure at the cave.

847
01:23:39,557 --> 01:23:41,516
But I've learned so much since then.

848
01:23:41,601 --> 01:23:44,311
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and finish what I've begun.

849
01:23:44,395 --> 01:23:46,396
You have my word.

850
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,316
It is you and your abilities
the emperor wants.

851
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,152
That is why your friends are made to suffer.

852
01:23:53,571 --> 01:23:56,281
That's why I have to go.

853
01:23:56,365 --> 01:24:00,744
Luke, I don't want to lose you
to the emperor the way I lost Vader.

854
01:24:00,828 --> 01:24:02,412
You won't.

855
01:24:03,164 --> 01:24:06,833
Stopped they must be. On this all depends.

856
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:11,171
Only a fully trained Jedi knight,
with the Force as his ally...

857
01:24:11,255 --> 01:24:13,882
will conquer Vader and his emperor.

858
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:16,092
If you end your training now...

859
01:24:16,177 --> 01:24:20,513
if you choose the quick and easy path,
as Vader did...

860
01:24:20,598 --> 01:24:23,266
you will become an agent of evil.

861
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:24,351
Patience.

862
01:24:25,269 --> 01:24:29,689
- And sacrifice Han and Leia?
- If you honor what they fight for...

863
01:24:29,774 --> 01:24:30,815
yes.

864
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:34,027
If you choose to face Vader,
you will do it alone.

865
01:24:34,111 --> 01:24:36,154
I cannot interfere.

866
01:24:38,115 --> 01:24:39,491
I understand.

867
01:24:44,914 --> 01:24:47,791
R2, fire up the converters.

868
01:24:53,089 --> 01:24:55,090
Don't give in to hate.

869
01:24:55,174 --> 01:24:57,968
That leads to the dark side.

870
01:24:58,052 --> 01:24:59,803
Strong is Vader.

871
01:24:59,887 --> 01:25:02,472
Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.

872
01:25:03,349 --> 01:25:04,891
I will.

873
01:25:04,976 --> 01:25:07,477
And I'll return. I promise.

874
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:17,612
Told you, I did. Reckless is he.

875
01:25:17,697 --> 01:25:19,322
Now...

876
01:25:19,407 --> 01:25:21,199
matters are worse.

877
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:23,368
That boy is our last hope.

878
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:26,413
No, there is another.

879
01:25:58,529 --> 01:26:01,865
The ship's almost finished. Two or three
more things and we're in great shape.

880
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:04,034
The sooner the better. Something's wrong here.

881
01:26:04,118 --> 01:26:06,202
No one has seen or knows anything about 3PO.

882
01:26:06,287 --> 01:26:08,538
He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.

883
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:10,373
Relax.

884
01:26:10,458 --> 01:26:13,376
I'll talk to Lando
and see what I can find out.

885
01:26:13,461 --> 01:26:15,962
I don't trust Lando.

886
01:26:16,047 --> 01:26:19,424
Well, I don't trust him either,
but he is my friend.

887
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:22,218
Besides, we'll soon be gone.

888
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:25,722
Then you're as good as gone, aren't you?

889
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:02,258
What happened?

890
01:27:03,302 --> 01:27:04,010
Where?

891
01:27:06,138 --> 01:27:08,181
Found him in a junk pile?

892
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:10,850
What a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

893
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:16,523
- Lando's got people that can fix him.
- No, thanks.

894
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:19,984
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything?

895
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:22,028
Not really.

896
01:27:25,533 --> 01:27:27,575
You look absolutely beautiful.

897
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:30,995
You truly belong here
with us among the clouds.

898
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,580
Thank you.

899
01:27:32,665 --> 01:27:35,625
Would you join me for a little refreshment?

900
01:27:35,709 --> 01:27:38,545
Everyone's invited, of course.

901
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:40,755
Having trouble with your droid?

902
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:43,508
No. No problem. Why?

903
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:54,853
You see, since we're a small operation...

904
01:27:54,937 --> 01:27:58,231
we don't fall into
the jurisdiction of the Empire.

905
01:27:58,315 --> 01:28:00,900
- So you're part of the Mining Guild?
- No, not actually.

906
01:28:00,985 --> 01:28:03,194
Our operation is small enough
not to be noticed.

907
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:05,363
Which is advantageous for everybody...

908
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:09,909
since our customers are anxious to avoid
attracting attention to themselves.

909
01:28:09,994 --> 01:28:13,913
Aren't you afraid the Empire's
gonna find out, shut you down?

910
01:28:13,998 --> 01:28:17,333
It's been a danger that looms like
a shadow over everything we've built.

911
01:28:17,418 --> 01:28:20,170
But things have developed
that'll ensure security.

912
01:28:20,254 --> 01:28:23,590
I've just made a deal that'll keep
the Empire out of here forever.

913
01:28:33,267 --> 01:28:36,102
We would be honored if you would join us.

914
01:28:42,902 --> 01:28:45,403
I had no choice.
They arrived right before you did.

915
01:28:46,197 --> 01:28:48,031
I'm sorry.

916
01:28:51,452 --> 01:28:52,869
I'm sorry too.

917
01:29:07,635 --> 01:29:09,093
No, 3PO's with them.

918
01:29:10,429 --> 01:29:12,597
Just hang on. We're almost there.

919
01:30:12,074 --> 01:30:14,575
I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to intrude.

920
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:16,661
No, please don't get up.

921
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:25,878
Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger.

922
01:30:25,963 --> 01:30:28,589
I must tell the others.
Oh, no! I've been shot!

923
01:30:56,285 --> 01:30:58,036
Lord Vader.

924
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:00,538
You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hutt...

925
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:02,665
after I have Skywalker.

926
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:04,667
He's no good to me dead.

927
01:31:04,752 --> 01:31:08,087
He will not be permanently damaged.

928
01:31:10,466 --> 01:31:13,051
Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?

929
01:31:13,135 --> 01:31:15,887
They must never again leave this city.

930
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:19,223
That wasn't part of our agreement,
nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!

931
01:31:19,308 --> 01:31:23,269
Perhaps you think you're
being treated unfairly?

932
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:27,023
No.

933
01:31:27,107 --> 01:31:30,735
Good. It would be unfortunate
if I had to leave a garrison here.

934
01:31:33,072 --> 01:31:35,490
This deal is getting worse all the time.

935
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:39,077
Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that.

936
01:31:40,662 --> 01:31:43,247
Something's not right because now I can't see.

937
01:31:45,751 --> 01:31:48,002
That's much better.

938
01:31:48,087 --> 01:31:49,754
Wait. Wait.

939
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:51,923
Oh, my! What have you done?

940
01:31:52,007 --> 01:31:53,591
I'm backwards!

941
01:31:53,675 --> 01:31:55,593
You flea-bitten furball!

942
01:31:55,677 --> 01:31:58,388
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough...

943
01:32:12,945 --> 01:32:14,946
I feel terrible.

944
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:32,255
Why are they doing this?

945
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:37,427
They never even asked me any questions.

946
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:48,938
- Get out of here, Lando.
- Shut up and listen.

947
01:32:49,022 --> 01:32:52,150
Vader's agreed
to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.

948
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:54,152
They'll have to stay here,
but they'll be safe.

949
01:32:54,236 --> 01:32:56,404
- And Han?
- Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.

950
01:32:56,488 --> 01:32:58,948
- Vader wants us all dead.
- He doesn't want you at all.

951
01:32:59,032 --> 01:33:02,452
He's after somebody called Skywalker.

952
01:33:02,536 --> 01:33:05,121
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.
- And we're the bait.

953
01:33:05,205 --> 01:33:07,123
- He's on his way.
- Perfect.

954
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,251
You fixed us all real good, didn't you?

955
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:11,544
My friend.

956
01:33:13,839 --> 01:33:15,047
Stop!

957
01:33:17,009 --> 01:33:19,218
I've done all I can.

958
01:33:19,303 --> 01:33:21,762
Sorry I couldn't do better,
but I got my own problems.

959
01:33:21,847 --> 01:33:23,181
Yeah.

960
01:33:23,265 --> 01:33:25,183
You're a real hero.

961
01:33:35,903 --> 01:33:38,404
You certainly have a way with people.

962
01:33:52,753 --> 01:33:54,629
This facility is crude...

963
01:33:54,713 --> 01:33:57,840
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker...

964
01:33:57,925 --> 01:34:00,218
for his journey to the emperor.

965
01:34:00,302 --> 01:34:03,346
Lord Vader, ship approaching, X-wing class.

966
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:06,849
Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.

967
01:34:08,352 --> 01:34:13,105
Lord Vader, we only use this facility
for carbon freezing. It might kill him.

968
01:34:13,190 --> 01:34:16,108
I do not want the emperor's prize damaged.

969
01:34:16,193 --> 01:34:19,320
We will test it on Captain Solo.

970
01:34:43,053 --> 01:34:47,306
If you'd attached my legs I wouldn't
be in this ridiculous position.

971
01:34:47,391 --> 01:34:50,101
Now remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility for me...

972
01:34:50,185 --> 01:34:51,936
so don't do anything foolish.

973
01:35:05,909 --> 01:35:08,119
What's going on, buddy?

974
01:35:08,954 --> 01:35:11,122
You're being put into carbon freeze.

975
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:14,750
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

976
01:35:14,835 --> 01:35:18,296
The Empire will compensate you
if he dies. Put him in.

977
01:35:22,175 --> 01:35:23,384
Chewbacca, stop!

978
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:25,511
No, Chewie, stop!

979
01:35:25,596 --> 01:35:28,639
You're going to get us all killed!
Yes, stop. I'm not ready to die.

980
01:35:28,724 --> 01:35:30,725
Hey! Hey! Listen to me.

981
01:35:30,809 --> 01:35:33,352
Chewie, this won't help me.

982
01:35:33,437 --> 01:35:36,105
Hey, save your strength.
There'll be another time.

983
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:39,567
The princess.

984
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:41,485
You have to take care of her.

985
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:45,698
Do you hear me?

986
01:35:59,546 --> 01:36:02,548
- I love you.
- I know.

987
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:35,373
What's going on? Turn round. I can't see.

988
01:37:34,474 --> 01:37:36,267
They've encased him in carbonite.

989
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:38,269
He should be quite well-protected...

990
01:37:38,353 --> 01:37:40,312
if he survived the freezing process, that is.

991
01:37:40,397 --> 01:37:42,940
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

992
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:44,692
Yes, he's alive.

993
01:37:45,527 --> 01:37:47,445
And in perfect hibernation.

994
01:37:48,363 --> 01:37:50,573
He's all yours, bounty hunter.

995
01:37:51,366 --> 01:37:53,117
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

996
01:37:55,495 --> 01:37:57,371
Skywalker has just landed, lord.

997
01:37:57,456 --> 01:38:01,417
Good. See to it that he finds his way in here.

998
01:38:05,589 --> 01:38:07,506
Calrissian...

999
01:38:07,591 --> 01:38:10,050
take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.

1000
01:38:10,135 --> 01:38:12,303
You said they'd be left under my supervision.

1001
01:38:12,387 --> 01:38:17,308
I am altering the deal.
Pray I don't alter it any further.

1002
01:39:54,531 --> 01:39:57,116
Luke, don't! It's a trap!

1003
01:39:58,577 --> 01:39:59,743
It's a trap!

1004
01:40:46,082 --> 01:40:48,500
The Force is with you, young Skywalker.

1005
01:40:50,879 --> 01:40:52,963
But you are not a Jedi yet.

1006
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:56,610
Well done.

1007
01:41:58,363 --> 01:42:01,198
Hold them in the security tower.
And keep it quiet.

1008
01:42:01,282 --> 01:42:03,033
Move.

1009
01:42:07,414 --> 01:42:10,749
- What do you think you're doing?
- We're getting out of here.

1010
01:42:10,834 --> 01:42:12,626
I knew all along. It had to be a mistake.

1011
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:15,587
Do you think that after what you did to Han...

1012
01:42:16,548 --> 01:42:19,883
- I had no choice.
- What are you doing? Trust him!

1013
01:42:19,968 --> 01:42:23,012
We understand, don't we, Chewie?
He had no choice.

1014
01:42:23,096 --> 01:42:24,680
I'm just trying to help.

1015
01:42:24,764 --> 01:42:27,433
We don't need any of your help.

1016
01:42:32,522 --> 01:42:34,064
What?

1017
01:42:34,149 --> 01:42:38,777
- It sounds like Han.
- There's still a chance to save Han...

1018
01:42:39,696 --> 01:42:43,032
at the east... platform.

1019
01:42:47,162 --> 01:42:49,329
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1020
01:42:49,414 --> 01:42:51,248
After all, he's only a Wookiee.

1021
01:42:52,125 --> 01:42:54,835
Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.

1022
01:43:10,018 --> 01:43:12,311
R2, where have you been?

1023
01:43:12,395 --> 01:43:14,313
Wait. Turn around, you woolly...

1024
01:43:15,482 --> 01:43:18,275
Hurry! We're trying to save
Han from the bounty hunter.

1025
01:43:20,987 --> 01:43:23,447
Well, at least you're still in one piece.

1026
01:43:23,531 --> 01:43:25,949
Look what's happened to me.

1027
01:43:37,837 --> 01:43:40,464
Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!

1028
01:43:53,394 --> 01:43:55,771
You have learned much, young one.

1029
01:43:55,855 --> 01:43:57,981
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

1030
01:44:09,577 --> 01:44:12,704
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.

1031
01:44:13,414 --> 01:44:16,041
Obi-Wan knew this to be true.

1032
01:44:24,092 --> 01:44:25,509
All too easy.

1033
01:44:30,682 --> 01:44:33,183
Perhaps you're not as strong
as the emperor thought.

1034
01:44:36,312 --> 01:44:38,021
Impressive.

1035
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:41,358
Most impressive.

1036
01:44:49,075 --> 01:44:52,911
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You have controlled your fear.

1037
01:44:55,665 --> 01:44:58,917
Now, release your anger.

1038
01:44:59,002 --> 01:45:01,670
Only your hatred can destroy me.

1039
01:47:12,552 --> 01:47:14,511
The security code has been changed.

1040
01:47:14,595 --> 01:47:17,973
R2, you can tell the computer
to override the security systems.

1041
01:47:18,850 --> 01:47:20,600
R2, hurry.

1042
01:47:23,354 --> 01:47:26,189
Attention.
This is Lando Calrissian. Attention.

1043
01:47:26,274 --> 01:47:28,275
The Empire has taken control of the city.

1044
01:47:28,359 --> 01:47:31,236
I advise everyone to leave
before more imperial troops arrive.

1045
01:47:37,702 --> 01:47:39,369
This way.

1046
01:47:39,454 --> 01:47:41,705
Well, don't blame me. I'm an interpreter.

1047
01:47:41,789 --> 01:47:44,708
I'm not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.

1048
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:09,232
We're not interested in the hyperdrive
on the falcon. It's fixed!

1049
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:17,074
Just open the door, you stupid lump!

1050
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:28,085
I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!

1051
01:48:52,527 --> 01:48:55,278
That hurts! Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow!

1052
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:03,787
Go!

1053
01:49:10,169 --> 01:49:13,004
I thought that hairy beast
would be the end of me.

1054
01:49:13,089 --> 01:49:15,006
Of course I've looked better.

1055
01:50:08,644 --> 01:50:12,355
You are beaten. It is useless to resist.

1056
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:15,984
Don't let yourself be destroyed
as Obi-Wan did.

1057
01:50:31,751 --> 01:50:33,418
There is no escape.

1058
01:50:34,253 --> 01:50:36,421
Don't make me destroy you.

1059
01:50:40,218 --> 01:50:43,178
You do not yet realize your importance.

1060
01:50:43,262 --> 01:50:45,972
You have only begun to discover your power.

1061
01:50:46,057 --> 01:50:47,933
Join me...

1062
01:50:48,017 --> 01:50:50,435
and I will complete your training.

1063
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:52,938
With our combined strength...

1064
01:50:53,022 --> 01:50:55,982
we can end this destructive conflict...

1065
01:50:56,067 --> 01:50:58,401
and bring order to the galaxy.

1066
01:50:58,486 --> 01:51:01,029
I'll never join you!

1067
01:51:01,113 --> 01:51:05,242
If you only knew the power of the dark side.

1068
01:51:05,326 --> 01:51:09,579
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

1069
01:51:09,664 --> 01:51:11,122
He told me enough.

1070
01:51:13,709 --> 01:51:15,585
He told me you killed him.

1071
01:51:17,338 --> 01:51:19,464
I am your father.

1072
01:51:27,974 --> 01:51:29,933
That's not true.

1073
01:51:30,768 --> 01:51:32,435
That's impossible!

1074
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:35,814
Search your feelings. You know it to be true.

1075
01:51:44,615 --> 01:51:48,785
You can destroy the emperor.
He has foreseen this.

1076
01:51:48,869 --> 01:51:51,788
It is your destiny.

1077
01:51:51,872 --> 01:51:53,623
Join me...

1078
01:51:53,708 --> 01:51:58,086
and together we can rule the galaxy
as father and son.

1079
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:10,307
Come with me.

1080
01:52:11,142 --> 01:52:13,351
It is the only way.

1081
01:53:19,585 --> 01:53:21,002
Ben.

1082
01:53:21,837 --> 01:53:23,713
Ben, please.

1083
01:53:51,617 --> 01:53:53,243
Hear me.

1084
01:54:00,167 --> 01:54:02,252
- We've got to go back.
- What?

1085
01:54:02,336 --> 01:54:04,754
- I know where Luke is.
- What about those fighters?

1086
01:54:05,798 --> 01:54:08,091
Chewie, just do it.

1087
01:54:08,175 --> 01:54:09,926
All right, all right!

1088
01:54:18,102 --> 01:54:22,230
Alert my Stardestroyer
to prepare for my arrival.

1089
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:34,784
Look, someone's up there.

1090
01:54:35,995 --> 01:54:38,496
It's Luke. Chewie, slow down.

1091
01:54:38,581 --> 01:54:41,916
We'll get under him.
Lando, open the top hatch.

1092
01:54:57,808 --> 01:55:00,185
Okay. Easy, Chewie.

1093
01:55:21,916 --> 01:55:24,125
- Lando?
- Okay, let's go.

1094
01:55:44,104 --> 01:55:45,563
All right, Chewie. Let's go.

1095
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:22,976
I'll be back.

1096
01:56:28,649 --> 01:56:30,108
Stardestroyer.

1097
01:56:35,322 --> 01:56:37,824
All right, Chewie. Ready for light speed.

1098
01:56:37,908 --> 01:56:39,993
If your people fixed the hyperdrive.

1099
01:56:40,077 --> 01:56:42,453
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.

1100
01:56:42,538 --> 01:56:44,038
Punch it!

1101
01:56:54,675 --> 01:56:57,010
They told me they fixed it.

1102
01:56:57,094 --> 01:56:59,012
I trusted them!

1103
01:56:59,096 --> 01:57:01,639
It's not my fault!

1104
01:57:07,229 --> 01:57:09,898
They'll be in range
of our tractor beam in moments, lord.

1105
01:57:09,982 --> 01:57:13,568
Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive
on the Millennium Falcon?

1106
01:57:13,652 --> 01:57:15,695
- Yes, my lord.
- Good.

1107
01:57:15,779 --> 01:57:19,449
Prepare the boarding party
and set your weapons for stun.

1108
01:57:19,533 --> 01:57:22,619
- Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

1109
01:57:24,121 --> 01:57:27,457
Noisy brute. Why don't we
just go into light speed?

1110
01:57:27,541 --> 01:57:29,167
We can't?

1111
01:57:29,251 --> 01:57:31,669
How would you know
the hyperdrive is deactivated?

1112
01:57:34,924 --> 01:57:37,842
The city's central computer told you?

1113
01:57:37,927 --> 01:57:40,720
R2-D2, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.

1114
01:57:40,804 --> 01:57:44,140
Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing.

1115
01:57:56,403 --> 01:57:57,612
Father.

1116
01:57:59,448 --> 01:58:01,616
Son, come with me.

1117
01:58:04,620 --> 01:58:06,079
Ben.

1118
01:58:07,122 --> 01:58:09,248
Why didn't you tell me?

1119
01:58:27,434 --> 01:58:28,685
It's Vader.

1120
01:58:34,483 --> 01:58:38,111
Luke, it is your destiny.

1121
01:58:45,786 --> 01:58:48,079
Why didn't you tell me?

1122
01:58:54,336 --> 01:58:58,339
Alert all commands.
Ready for the tractor beam.

1123
01:59:01,719 --> 01:59:04,512
R2, come back at once!
You haven't finished with me yet.

1124
01:59:04,596 --> 01:59:08,141
You don't know how to fix the
hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it.

1125
01:59:08,225 --> 01:59:12,729
I'm standing here in pieces
and you're having delusions of grandeur!

1126
01:59:15,816 --> 01:59:17,358
You did it!

1127
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:18,086
- Luke, we're ready for takeoff.
- Good luck, Lando.

1128
02:00:19,046 --> 02:00:23,049
When we find Jabba the Hutt and
that bounty hunter, we'll contact you.

1129
02:00:23,133 --> 02:00:25,802
I'll meet you at
the rendezvous point on Tatooine.

1130
02:00:25,886 --> 02:00:29,347
Princess, we'll find Han. I promise.

1131
02:00:29,431 --> 02:00:31,682
Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal.

1132
02:00:31,767 --> 02:00:33,518
Take care, you two.

1133
02:00:33,602 --> 02:00:35,686
May the Force be with you.

1134
02:07:19,174 --> 02:07:20,174
English - US

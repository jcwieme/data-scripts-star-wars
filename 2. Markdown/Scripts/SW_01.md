> Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to outlaying star systems is in dispute. Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of Naboo. While the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the conflict

* **QUI-GON** to **REPUBLIC PILOT** : Captain.
* **REPUBLIC PILOT** to **QUI-GON** : Yes, sir?
* **QUI-GON** to **REPUBLIC PILOT** : Tell them we wish to board at once.
* **REPUBLIC PILOT** to **QUI-GON** : Yes, sir.
* **REPUBLIC PILOT** to **NUTE** : With all due respect the ambassadors for the supreme chancellor wish to board immediately.
* **NUTE** to **REPUBLIC PILOT** : Yes, yes, of course as you know, our blockade is perfectly legal, and we'd be happy to receive the Ambassador. Happy to.

*INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE*

* **TC-14** to **QUI-GON** : I'm TC-14 at your service. This way, please.

*INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM*

* **TC-14** to **QUI-GON** : We are greatly honored by your visit, Ambassadors. Make yourselves comfortable. My master will be with you shortly.
* **OBI-WAN** to **QUI-GON** : I have a bad feeling about this.
* **QUI-GON** to **OBI-WAN** : I don't sense anything.
* **OBI-WAN** to **QUI-GON** : It's not about the mission, Master, it's something, elsewhere, elusive.
* **QUI-GON** to **OBI-WAN** : Don't center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration here and now where it belongs.
* **OBI-WAN** to **QUI-GON** : Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future
* **QUI-GON** to **OBI-WAN** : but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the living Force, my young Padawan.
* **OBI-WAN** to **QUI-GON** : Yes, Master how do you think the trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor's demands?
* **QUI-GON** to **OBI-WAN** : These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be short.

*INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE*

* **NUTE** to **TC-14** : What?!? What did you say?
* **TC-14** to **NUTE** : The Ambassadors are Jedi Knights, I believe.
* **DOFINE** to **NUTE** : I knew it! They were sent to force a settlement, eh.
* **NUTE** to **DOFINE** : Distract them. I will contact Lord Sidious.
* **DOFINE** to **NUTE** : Are you brain-dead? I'm not going in there with two Jedi .Send a droid.

*INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM*

* **OBI-WAN** to **QUI-GON** : Is it in their nature to make us wait this long?
* **QUI-GON** to **OBI-WAN** : No. I sense an unusual amount of fear for something as trivial as this trade dispute.

*INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE*

* **DARTH SIDIOUS** to **NUTE** : What is it?
* **DOFINE** to **DARTH SIDIOUS** : This scheme of yours has failed, Lord Sidious. The blockade is finished. We dare not go against these Jedi.
* **DARTH SIDIOUS** to **NUTE** : Viceroy, I don't want this stunted slime in my sight again. This turn of events is unfortunate. We must accelerate our plans. Begin landing your troops.
* **NUTE** to **DARTH SIDIOUS** : My lord, is that legal?
* **DARTH SIDIOUS** to **NUTE** : I will make it legal.
* **NUTE** to **DARTH SIDIOUS** : And the Jedi?
* **DARTH SIDIOUS** to **NUTE** : The chancellor should never have brought them into this. Kill them immediately.
* **NUTE** to **DARTH SIDIOUS** : Yes, my lord. As you wish.

*INT. REPUBLIC CRUISER - COCKPIT*

* **REPUBLIC PILOT** to **QUI-GON** : Shields up!

*INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM*

* **TC-14** to **QUI-GON** : Sorry.

*INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE*

* **NUTE** to **TEY HOW** : What in blazes is going on down there?
* **TEY HOW** to **NUTE** : We lost the transmission, sir.
* **RUNE** to **NUTE** : Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir?
* **NUTE** to **RUNE** : Well, not exactly, but I don't seal off the bridge.
* **RUNE** to **NUTE** : That won't be enough, sir.
* **NUTE** to **RUNE** : I want destroyer droids up here at once!
* **RUNE** to **NUTE** : We will not survive this.

*INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE*

* **NUTE** to **TEY HOW** : Close the blast doors!
* **NUTE** to **TEY HOW** : That will hold them.
* **RUNE** to **NUTE** : They're still coming through!
* **NUTE** to **RUNE** : Impossible! This is impossible!
* **RUNE** to **NUTE** : Where are those destroyer droids?!

*INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE*

* **OBI-WAN** to **QUI-GON** : Master! Destroyers!
* **OBI-WAN** to **QUI-GON** : They have shield generators!
* **QUI-GON** to **OBI-WAN** : It's a standoff. Let's go.

*INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE*

* **RUNE** to **NUTE** : They're no match for destroyer droids.
* **TEY HOW** to **NUTE** : Sir, they've gone up the ventilation shaft.

*INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - MAIN BAY*

* **QUI-GON** to **OBI-WAN** : Battle droids.
* **OBI-WAN** to **QUI-GON** : It's an invasion army.
* **QUI-GON** to **OBI-WAN** : It's an odd play for the Trade Federation. We've got to warn the Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let's split up. Stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet.
* **OBI-WAN** to **QUI-GON** : You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were short.

*INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE*

* **TEY HOW** to **NUTE** : Sir, a transmission from the planet.
* **RUNE** to **NUTE** : It's Queen Amidala herself.
* **NUTE** to **RUNE** : At last we're getting results.
* **NUTE** to **NUTE** : Again you come before me, Your highness.
* **AMIDALA** to **NUTE** : You will not be pleased when you hear what I have to say, Viceroy Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.
* **NUTE** to **AMIDALA** : I was not aware of such a failure.
* **AMIDALA** to **NUTE** : I have word that the chancellor's ambassadors are with you now and that you have been commanded to reach settlement.
* **NUTE** to **AMIDALA** : I know nothing of any ambassadors. You must be mistaken.
* **AMIDALA** to **NUTE** : Beware, Viceroy the Federation is going too far this time.
* **NUTE** to **AMIDALA** : We would never do anything without the approval of the senate. You assume too much.
* **AMIDALA** to **NUTE** : We will see.
* **RUNE** to **NUTE** : She's right, the Senate will never
* **NUTE** to **RUNE** : It's too late now.
* **RUNE** to **NUTE** : Do you think she suspects an attack?
* **NUTE** to **NUTE** : I don't know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications down there.

*INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM*

* **PALPATINE** to **AMIDALA** : Negotiations haven't started because the ambassadors aren't there? How could that be true? I have assurances from the chancellor his ambassadors did arrive. It must handiwork negotiate ambassadors
* **AMIDALA** to **PALPATINE** : Senator Palpatine?!? What's happening?
* **BIBBLE** to **AMIDALA** : A communications disruption can mean only one thing: invasion.
* **PANAKA** to **AMIDALA** : It could be the Federation jamming us. Your Highness.
* **BIBBLE** to **AMIDALA** : A communications disruption can only mean one thing. Invasion.
* **AMIDALA** to **BIBBLE** : The Federation would not dare go that far.
* **PANAKA** to **AMIDALA** : The Senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be finished.
* **AMIDALA** to **BIBBLE** : We must continue to rely on negotiation.
* **BIBBLE** to **AMIDALA** : Negotiation? We've lost all communications! and where are the Chancellors Ambassadors?
* **PANAKA** to **AMIDALA** : This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our security volunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army.
* **AMIDALA** to **PANAKA** : I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war.

*EXT. NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP / GRASS PLAINS - TWILIGHT (FX)*

* **CAPORAL DROID** to **NUTE** : Yes, Viceroy ?
* **RUNE** to **CAPORAL DROID** : Captain, we've searched the ship and there is no trace of the Jedi. They may have gotten on one of your landing craft.
* **CAPORAL DROID** to **NUTE** : If they are down here, sir, we'll find them.
* **NUTE** to **CAPORAL DROID** : Use caution. These Jedi are not to be underestimated.

* **QUI-GON** to **AMIDALA** : They will kill you if you stay.
* **BIBBLE** to **QUI-GON** :They wouldn't dare.
* **PANAKA** to **QUI-GON** : They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion of theirs legal. They can't afford to kill her.
* **QUI-GON** to **AMIDALA** : The situation here is not what it seems. There is something else behind all this, Your Highness. There is no logic in the Federation's move here. My feelings tell me they will destroy you.

* **PANAKA** to **QUI-GON** : You can't take Her Royal Highness there! The Hutts are gangsters If they discovered her
* **QUI-GON** to **PANAKA** : It would be no different than if we landed on a system controlled by the Federation except the Hutts aren't looking for her, which gives us an advantage.

* **ANAKIN** to **QUI-GON** : I'm the only human who can do it.

* **QUI-GON** to **ANAKIN** : What makes you think that?
* **ANAKIN** to **QUI-GON** : I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.
* **QUI-GON** to **ANAKIN** : Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it from him.
* **ANAKIN** to **QUI-GON** : I don't think so No one can kill a Jedi Knight.

* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair it.
* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : I can help! I can fix anything!
* **QUI-GON** to **ANAKIN** : I believe you can, but our first job is to aquire the parts we need
* **JAR JAR** to **ANAKIN** : Wit no-nutten mula to trade.
* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.
* **SHMI** to **PADME** : Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful races.

* **SHMI** to **ANAKIN** : I don't want you to race, Annie It's awful. I die every time Watto makes you do it.
* **ANAKIN** to **SHMI** : But Mom, I love it and they need help they're in trouble. The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need.
* **SHMI** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin
* **QUI-GON** to **ANAKIN** : Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who might be able to help us?
* **SHMI** to **QUI-GON** : No
* **ANAKIN** to **SHMI** : Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.
* **PADME** to **SHMI** : I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We will find another way

* **ANAKIN** to **QUI-GON** : Ahhhh it wasn't my fault really Sebulba flashed me with his vent ports. I actually saved the Pod mostly.
* **WATTO** to **ANAKIN** : That you did. The boy is good, no doubts there.
* **QUI-GON** to **WATTO** : I have acquired a Pod in a game of chance. "The fastest ever built."
* **WATTO** to **QUI-GON** : I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it. So, you supply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings fifty-fifty, I think.
* **QUI-GON** to **WATTO** : Fifty-fifty!?! If it's going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you front the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts I need If we lose, you keep my ship.

* **SHMI** to **QUI-GON** : He deserves better than a slave's life.
* **QUI-GON** to **SHMI** : Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identified him early. The Force is unusally strong with him, that much is clear. Who was his father?
* **SHMI** to **QUI-GON** : There was no father, that I know of I carried him, I gave him birth I can't explain what happened. Can you help him?

* **QUI-GON** to **WATTO** : You don't think Anakin will win?
* **WATTO** to **QUI-GON** : Don't get me wrongo. I have great faith in the boy. He's a credit to your race, but Sebulba there is going to win, I think.
* **QUI-GON** to **WATTO** : Why do you think that?
* **WATTO** to **QUI-GON** : He always wins. I'm betting heavily on Sebulba.
* **QUI-GON** to **WATTO** : I'll take that bet.
* **WATTO** to **QUI-GON** : What?! What do you mean?
* **QUI-GON** to **WATTO** : I'll wager my new racing pod against say the boy and his mother.
* **WATTO** to **QUI-GON** : A Pod for slaves. I don't think so well, poerhaps. Just one the mother, maybe the boy isn't for sale.
* **QUI-GON** to **WATTO** : The boy is small, he can't be worth much.
* **QUI-GON** to **WATTO** : For the fastest Pod ever built?!
* **QUI-GON** to **WATTO** : Both, or no bet.
* **WATTO** to **QUI-GON** : No Pod's worth two slaves not by a long shot one slave or nothing.
* **QUI-GON** to **WATTO** : The boy, then
* **WATTO** to **QUI-GON** : We'll let fate decide. Blue it's the boy, red his mother. You won the small toss, outlander, but you won't win the race, so it makes little difference.

There is no interest in the common good no civility, only politics its disgusting. I must be frank, Your Majesty, there is little chance the Senate will act on the invasion.
* **AMIDALA** to **PALAPATINE** : Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.
* **PALPATINE** to **AMADILA** : If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real power he is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption. A manufactured scandal surrounds him. The bureaucrats are in charge now.
* **AMIDALA** to **PALPATINE** : What options do we have?
* **PALPATINE** to **AMIDALA** : Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger Supreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the bureaucrats, enforces the laws, and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.
* **AMIDALA** to **PALPATINE** : He has been our strongest supporter.
* **PALPATINE** to **AMIDALA** : Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the courts
* **AMIDALA** to **PALPATINE** : There's no time for that. The courts take even longer to decide things than the Senate. Our people are dying, Senator more and more each day. We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.
* **PALPATINE** to **AMIDALA** : To be realistic, Your Highness, I'd say we're going to have to accept Federation control for the time being.

* **AMIDALA** to **SENAT** : Honorable representatives of the Republic, distinguished delegates, and Your Honor Supreme Chancellor Valorum, I come to you under the gravest of circumstances. The Naboo system has been invaded by force. Invaded against all the laws of the Republic by the Droid Armies of the Trade
* **LOTT DOD** to **SENAT** : I object! There is no proof. This is incredible. We recommend a commision be sent to Naboo to assertain the truth.
* **AKS MOE** to **SENAT** : The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate from the Trade Federation. A commision must be appointed that is the law.
* **VALORUM** to **SENAT** : The point
* **PALPATINE** to **AMIDALA** : Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength will dissapear.
* **VALORUM** to **AMIDALA** : The point is conceded Section 523A take precedence here. Queen Amidala of the Naboo, will you defer your motion to allow a commission to explore the validity of your accusations?
* **AMIDALA** to **VALORUM** : I will not defer I have come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a "vote of no confidence" in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.
* **MAS AMEDDA** to **SENAT** : Order! We shall have order

* **BOSS NASS** to **JAR JAR** : So, wesa maken yousa Bombad General.
* **JAR JAR** to **BOSS NASS** : General?! Oh, no
* **PADME** to **PANAKA** : What is the situation?
* **PANAKA** to **PADME** : Almost everyone's in camps. A few hundred police and guards have formed an underground movement. I brought as many of the keaders as I could. The Federation Army's also much larger than we thought, and much stronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win.
* **PADME** to **CAPR. PANAKA** : The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw the Droid Army away from the cities. We can enter the city using the secret passages on the waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, PANAKA will create a diversion, so that we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy. Without the Viceroy, they will be lost and confused. What do you think, Master Jedi?
* **QUI-GON** to **PADME** : The Viceroy will be well guarded.
* **PANAKA** to **PADME** : The difficulty's getting into the throne room. Once we're inside, we shouldn't have a problem.
* **QUI-GON** to **BOSS NASS** : There is a possibility with this diversion many Gungans will be killed.
* **BOSS NASS** to **QUI-GON** : Wesa ready to do are-sa part.

* **QUI-GON** to **PADME** : A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk. The weapons on your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship.
* **OBI-WAN** to **PADME** : And there's an even bigger danger. If the Vicroy escapes, Your Highness, he will return with another droid army.
* **PADME** to **OBI-WAN** : That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everything depends on it.
* **ARTOO** to **PADME** : beeps

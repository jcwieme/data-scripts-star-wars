1
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:02,414
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

2
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:04,708
Tell them we wish to board at once.

3
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,627
With all due respect...

4
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:10,964
the ambassadors for the supreme chancellor
wish to board immediately.

5
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,966
Yes, of course.

6
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,177
As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal...

7
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:20,390
and we'd be happy to
receive the ambassadors.

8
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,498
I'm TC-14 at your service.

9
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,500
This way, please.

10
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:56,676
We are greatly honored
by your visit, Ambassadors.

11
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:58,678
Make yourselves comfortable.

12
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:01,139
My master will be with you shortly.

13
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:07,312
I have a bad feeling about this.

14
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:10,440
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

15
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:14,486
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

16
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,988
Don't center on your anxieties, Obi-Wan.

17
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:20,241
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

18
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:23,203
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

19
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,330
But not at the expense of the moment.

20
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,374
Be mindful of the living
Force, young Padawan.

21
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,418
Yes, Master.

22
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:36,257
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

23
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:38,510
These Federation types are cowards.

24
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,471
The negotiations will be short.

25
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,849
What? What did you say?

26
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:47,977
The ambassadors are Jedi
knights, I believe.

27
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:49,938
I knew it.

28
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,315
They're here to force a settlement.

29
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:56,736
Distract them. I will contact Lord Sidious.

30
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:58,446
Are you brain-dead?

31
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:01,407
I'm not going in there with two Jedi.

32
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,494
Send a droid.

33
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,793
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

34
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,254
No. I sense an unusual amount of fear...

35
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,506
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

36
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:29,310
What is it?

37
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:32,063
This scheme of yours has
failed, Lord Sidious.

38
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:35,733
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

39
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:40,697
Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.

40
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:46,077
This turn of events is unfortunate.
We must accelerate our plans.

41
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:48,788
Begin landing your troops.

42
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:52,625
My lord, is that legal?

43
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,044
I will make it legal.

44
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,463
And the Jedi?

45
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:00,091
The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.

46
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:01,968
Kill them immediately.

47
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:06,389
Yes, my lord. As you wish.

48
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:10,059
Captain, look!

49
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,562
Shields up!

50
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,901
Sorry.

51
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:21,571
Dioxis.

52
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,037
They must be dead by now.

53
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,831
Destroy what's left of them.

54
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,342
Excuse me.

55
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,428
- Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
- Roger, roger.

56
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:48,056
Uh-oh. Blast them.

57
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,355
What is going on down there?

58
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,440
We lost the transmission, sir.

59
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,948
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

60
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:08,034
Well, no, but I don't...
Seal off the bridge.

61
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,828
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

62
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,914
I want droidekas up here at once!

63
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,625
We will not survive this.

64
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,596
Close the blast doors!

65
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,355
That will hold them.

66
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:48,574
They are still coming through.

67
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,618
This is impossible!

68
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,959
Where are those droidekas?

69
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,296
Master! Destroyers!

70
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:09,053
They have shield generators!

71
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,224
It's a standoff. Let's go.

72
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,939
They're no match for droidekas.

73
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:21,733
Sir!

74
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,527
They've gone up the ventilation shaft.

75
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,997
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

76
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,376
This is an odd play for
the Trade Federation.

77
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,629
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

78
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,298
Let's split up.

79
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,634
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

80
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,553
You were right about one thing, Master.

81
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,224
The negotiations were short.

82
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:58,811
Sir, a transmission from the planet.

83
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:01,022
It's Queen Amidala herself.

84
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,566
At last we are getting results.

85
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,945
Again you come before us, Your Highness.

86
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,157
You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.

87
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,994
Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.

88
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,663
I was not aware of such failure.

89
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,500
I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...

90
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,336
and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.

91
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,713
I know nothing of any ambassadors.

92
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:28,216
You must be mistaken.

93
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,343
Beware, Viceroy.

94
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,137
The Federation has gone too far this time.

95
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:37,308
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

96
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:39,977
You assume too much.

97
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:41,479
We will see.

98
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:47,068
- She's right. The senate will never...
- It's too late now.

99
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,154
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

100
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:54,659
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

101
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:03,918
Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?

102
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,212
How could that be true?

103
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:10,675
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

104
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,554
It must... handiwork...
negotiate... ambassadors...

105
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,306
- nobody would...
- Senator Palpatine.

106
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,308
What's happening?

107
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,310
Check the transmission generator.

108
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:26,274
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

109
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,693
The Federation would not dare go that far.

110
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:32,613
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

111
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:35,575
We must continue to rely on negotiation.

112
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,911
Negotiation? We've lost all communications.

113
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,372
And where are the chancellor's ambassadors?

114
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,168
This is a dangerous
situation, Your Highness.

115
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,378
Our security volunteers will be no match...

116
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:49,672
against a battle-hardened Federation army.

117
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:54,927
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

118
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,840
Yes, Viceroy?

119
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:36,719
Captain, we've searched the ship
and there is no trace of the Jedi.

120
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,597
They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.

121
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,183
If they're down here, sir, we'll find them.

122
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:46,646
Use caution.
These Jedi are not to be underestimated.

123
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,245
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

124
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,081
Get down!

125
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,969
Was'n dat? Hey, wait!

126
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,638
Oh, mooie-mooie, I love you.

127
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,807
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

128
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,559
I spake.

129
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,811
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

130
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,814
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

131
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,984
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

132
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,194
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

133
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,197
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

134
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:40,241
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!

135
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,334
You saved my again.

136
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,336
- What's this?
- A local.

137
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:55,006
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

138
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,551
More? "More" did you spake?

139
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:03,514
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

140
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:06,851
Is where I grew up. 'Tis a hidden city.

141
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,354
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

142
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,273
Can you take us there?

143
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,609
On second thought, no.

144
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,236
- Not really, no.
- No?

145
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,488
'Tis embarrassing...

146
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:23,576
but my afraid my've been banished.

147
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,787
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

148
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:29,957
Terrible tings to me if me goen back dare.

149
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:33,085
- You hear that?
- Yah.

150
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,964
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

151
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,675
If they find us, they will crush us...

152
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,347
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

153
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,351
Yousa point is well seen.

154
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,853
Dis way. Hurry!

155
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,445
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

156
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,072
Ah, my warning you.

157
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:05,701
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

158
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:09,163
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

159
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:22,009
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

160
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,224
So good bein home!

161
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:29,160
Hey, yousa. Stopa dare.

00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,662
Heyo-dales, Cap'n Tarpals.

Mesa back.

164
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,709
Noah gain, Jar Jar. Yousa goen tada bosses.

165
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,462
Yousa in big dudu dis time.

166

How wude.

167
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:57,897
Yousa cannot bees hair.

168
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:02,526
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

169
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:07,531
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

170
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:11,285
Wesa no like da Naboo.

171
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:14,163
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

172
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,208
Day tink day brains so big.

173
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:21,462
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

174
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,923
Mesa no tink so.

175
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,884
Day not know of uss-en.

176
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,970
You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle.

177
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:33,474
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

178
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:38,354
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

179
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,023
Then speed us on our way.

180
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,692
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

181
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,570
We could use a transport.

182
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:49,532
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

183
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,743
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

184
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:57,623
'tis goen through the planet core.

185
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,583
Now...

186
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,544
go.

187
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,879
Thank you for your help. We leave in peace.

188
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,090
Master, what's a bongo?

189
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,175
A transport, I hope.

190
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,344
Deysa setten yousa up.

191
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:14,139
Goen through da planet core? Bad bombin'.

192
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,394
Any help here would be hot.

193
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,605
Master, we're short on time.

194
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,401
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.

195
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,444
This Gungan may be of help.

196
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:32,658
What is to become of Jar Jar Binks here?

197
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:37,705
Hisen to be pune-ished.

198
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:39,999
I saved his life.

199
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,585
He owes me what you call a "life-debt."

200
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:46,547
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

201
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,049
Binks...

202
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:53,137
yousa havena liveplay with thisen hisen?

203
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,729
Begone wit him!

204
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:06,775
Count me outta dis one.

205
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,029
Better dead here than dead in da core.

206
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:13,282
Yee gods! What mesa sayin?

207
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:34,303
Dis is nutsen. Oh, gooberfish!

208
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,640
- Why were you banished, Jar Jar?
- It's a longo tale-o...

209
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:42,811
buta a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

210
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:47,775
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

211
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:04,917
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

212
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,086
Yud-say boom da gasser...

213
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,005
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.

214
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,348
Big gooberfish! Huge-o teeth!

215
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:34,196
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

216
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,794
The invasion is on schedule, my lord.

217
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,880
I have the senate bogged
down in procedures.

218
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:56,468
They will have no choice but
to accept your control of the system.

219
00:18:56,553 --> 00:19:01,265
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

220
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,393
Queen Amidala is young and naive.

221
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,938
You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.

222
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:09,982
Yes, my lord.

223
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,319
You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi.

224
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:18,949
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

225
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:27,166
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

226
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,085
Oh, maxi big, da Force.

227
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,963
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

228
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,759
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

229
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,975
Wesa dyin' here.

230
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,728
- Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet"?

231
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,856
Monsters out dare. Leak'n in here.

232
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,944
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

233
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,114
Power's back.

234
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,742
Monster's back!

235
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,335
Relax.

236
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,920
You overdid it.

237
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,730
Head for that outcropping.

238
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,774
Oh, boy.

239
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,145
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

240
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:13,981
Ah, victory.

241
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,663
Dis'n loverly.

242
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,172
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

243
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:42,467
The queen and I will sign a treaty
that will legitimize our occupation here.

244
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:45,762
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

245
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:49,349
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

246
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:53,562
In time, your people's suffering
will persuade you to see our point of view.

247
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:56,857
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

248
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,609
Process them.

249
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:00,527
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

250
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:02,279
Roger, roger.

251
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:59,378
We should leave the street, Your Highness.

252
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,129
Get their weapons.

253
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:05,217
Yousa guys bombad!

254
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,221
We're ambassadors for
the supreme chancellor.

255
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,223
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

256
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,141
The negotiations never took place.

257
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,644
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

258
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,896
They've knocked out all our communications.

259
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:21,358
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

260
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:29,408
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

261
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:33,036
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

262
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:36,248
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

263
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,084
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

264
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,378
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

265
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,921
They can't afford to kill her.

266
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:45,173
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

267
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:47,259
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

268
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,303
My feelings tell me they will destroy you.

269
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:51,847
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

270
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,391
Senator Palpatine will need your help.

271
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:58,520
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

272
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,522
We are brave, Your Highness.

273
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,859
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

274
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,486
Then I will plead our case to the senate.

275
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,323
Be careful, Governor.

276
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,334
We'll need to free those pilots.

277
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,462
I'll deal with that.

278
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:27,966
Halt.

279
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,760
I'm ambassador to the supreme chancellor.

280
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:31,470
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

281
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:34,806
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

282
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:37,559
Coruscant? U h, that doesn't compute.

283
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,561
Uh, wait. U h, you're under arrest.

284
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,234
Come on. Move!

285
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:52,574
Go!

286
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:21,478
Now, stay here and keep out of trouble.

287
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:27,442
Hello, boyos.

288
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,409
There's the blockade.

289
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,462
The shield generator's been hit!

290
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,514
How wude!

291
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,151
We're losing droids fast.

292
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:12,612
If we can't get the shield generator fixed,
we'll be sitting ducks.

293
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:15,991
The shields are gone.

294
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,500
The power's back!

295
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:31,756
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

296
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:34,468
Deflector shields up at maximum.

297
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:47,731
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

298
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:50,734
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

299
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,028
Here, Master. Tatooine.

300
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,863
It's small, out of the way, poor.

301
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,740
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

302
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,700
How can you be sure?

303
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,744
It's controlled by the Hutts.

304
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:03,705
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

305
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,124
- If they discovered her...
- It'd be no different than landing...

306
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:08,126
on a system controlled by the Federation...

307
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:10,337
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her...

308
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,547
which gives us the advantage.

309
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:20,013
And Queen Amidala, has
she signed the treaty?

310
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:23,767
She has disappeared, my lord.

311
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:28,063
One Naboo cruiser got past the blockade.

312
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:31,149
I want that treaty signed.

313
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:33,276
My lord...

314
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:35,987
it's impossible to locate the ship.

315
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:38,281
It's out of our range.

316
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,659
Not for a Sith.

317
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:43,161
This is my apprentice...

318
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:45,163
Darth Maul.

319
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:49,793
He will find your lost ship.

320
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,424
This is getting out of hand.

321
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,593
Now there are two of them.

322
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:01,721
We should not have made this bargain.

323
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:10,564
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

324
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:13,567
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

325
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:17,070
It is to be commended. What is its number?

326
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:21,825
R2-D2, Your Highness.

327
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,410
Thank you, R2-D2.

328
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,582
Padmé.

329
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,252
Clean this droid up as best you can.

330
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,337
It deserves our gratitude.

331
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,674
Continue, Captain.

332
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:42,470
Your Highness, with your permission...

333
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:45,348
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

334
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:48,810
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

335
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,563
I do not agree with the Jedi on this.

336
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:54,566
You must trust my judgment, Your Highness.

337
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,696
Hello.

338
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,824
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

339
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,368
I'm Padmé.

340
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:08,496
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.

341
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,665
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

342
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:16,504
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

343
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:20,300
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen.

344
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:23,219
Den boom! Getten berry scared...

Mesa getten berry, berry scared.

347
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:39,903
- That's it... Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

348
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:44,157
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

349
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:04,177
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

350
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,763
That'll complicate things. Be wary.

351
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:10,016
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

352
00:30:10,101 --> 00:30:12,185
Don't let them send any transmissions.

353
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,694
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.

354
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:22,320
Wait!

355
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:24,823
Wait.

356
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:31,121
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

357
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:35,041
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

358
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:37,210
The spaceport is not going to be pleasant.

359
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,462
The queen wishes it.

360
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:41,548
She's curious about the planet.

361
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:47,137
This is not a good idea. Stay close to me.

362
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:03,778
Moisture farms, for the most part.

363
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,783
Some indigenous tribes and scavengers.

364
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:10,785
The few spaceports like this one...

365
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,204
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

366
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:15,248
Like us.

367
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,377
Dissen berry, berry bad.

368
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:22,464
Icky, icky goo!

369
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:37,896
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

370
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,487
Good day to you.

371
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,531
What do you want?

372
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:51,743
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

373
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:55,955
Ah, yes! Nubian. We have lots of that.

374
00:31:56,624 --> 00:31:58,541
Boy, get in here now!

375
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:00,543
My droid has a readout of what I need.

376
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,839
What took you so long?

377
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,050
I was cleaning the fan switches.

378
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,928
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

379
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:13,306
So, let me take thee out back, huh?

380
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,308
We'll find what you need.

381
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,521
Don't touch anything.

382
00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:32,784
- Are you an angel?
- What?

383
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:36,621
An angel. I heard the deep space pilots
talk about them.

384
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,624
They're the most beautiful creatures
in the universe.

385
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,335
They live on the moons of Iego, I think.

386
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:46,756
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?

387
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:50,718
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

388
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:55,139
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

389
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:59,227
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

390
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,646
How long have you been here?

391
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,775
Since I was very little. Three, I think.

392
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,611
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...

393
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:11,447
but she lost us betting on the Podraces.

394
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:13,366
You're a slave?

395
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:17,662
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

396
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:21,541
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

397
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:35,471
- I got ya.
- Hey!

398
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,390
Hit the nose.

399
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:45,565
A T-14 hyperdrive generator. Thee in luck.

400
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:48,318
I'm the only one hereabouts who has one.

401
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:51,946
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

402
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:54,991
Saying of which...

403
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,493
how's thee gonna pay for all this, huh?

404
00:33:57,578 --> 00:33:59,704
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

405
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,623
Republic credits?

406
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,709
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

407
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,921
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

408
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:11,716
- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.

409
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,635
No, they won't!

410
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:17,931
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

411
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:22,310
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

412
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:26,564
No money, no parts, no deal.

413
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:31,194
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

414
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:42,330
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

415
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:47,961
We're leaving. Jar Jar.

416
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:53,132
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

417
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:55,134
I was glad to meet you too.

418
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:08,022
Outlanders. They think we know nothing.

419
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:10,066
They seemed nice to me.

420
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,110
Clean the racks...

421
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:13,569
...then you can go home.

422
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:15,530
Yippee!

423
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,913
And you're sure there's
nothing left on board?

424
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:25,957
A few containers of supplies.

425
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:29,085
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with...

426
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,546
not in the amount you're talking about.

427
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,590
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

428
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:36,092
I'll check back later.

429
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:38,553
Noah gain. Noah gain.

430
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,514
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

431
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:44,100
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

432
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:47,395
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

433
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,078
Are you going to pay for that?

434
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,957
It costs seven wupiupi.

435
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:14,589
Oops.

436
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:20,970
Is this yours?

437
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:22,889
Who, mesa...

438
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:29,145
Careful, Sebulba.

439
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,272
He's a big-time outlander.

440
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,942
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

441
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:38,946
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

442
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:42,116
If you weren't a slave, I'd squash you now.

443
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:45,661
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

444
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:49,415
- Hi.
- Hi there.

445
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,876
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.

446
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,878
He picked a fight with a Dug...

447
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:56,464
an especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba.

448
00:36:56,548 --> 00:37:00,218
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

449
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:04,305
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

450
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:06,307
Thanks, my young friend.

451
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,478
But mesa doen nutten!

452
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:21,572
This storm will slow them down.

453
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:23,199
Looks pretty bad.

454
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,036
- Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home.

455
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:28,955
We'll be right there.

456
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:37,547
Here, you'll like these pallies.

457
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:40,299
- Here.
- Thank you.

458
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:43,719
My bones are aching.

459
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:48,391
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

460
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:51,352
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

461
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:54,063
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

462
00:37:54,148 --> 00:37:56,607
You'll never reach the outskirts in time.

463
00:37:56,692 --> 00:38:00,570
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

464
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:03,156
Come on. I'll take you to my place.

465
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:19,088
Mom!

466
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:22,925
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cozy.

467
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,428
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

468
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:29,098
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

469
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:31,601
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

470
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:33,686
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.

471
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:46,741
Isn't he great? He's not finished yet.

472
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,201
He's wonderful.

473
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,120
You really like him?

474
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:54,207
He's a protocol droid to help Mom. Watch.

475
00:38:58,545 --> 00:38:59,879
Where is everybody?

476
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,172
Whoops.

477
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:05,551
Oh, hello.

478
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:09,013
I am C-3PO, human cyborg relations.

479
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,973
How might I serve you?

480
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:13,184
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

481
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:17,605
When the storm is over, I'll show you my racer.
I'm building a Podracer.

482
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:21,484
I'm not sure this floor is entirely stable.

483
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:24,820
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

484
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,991
R2-D2. A pleasure to meet you.

485
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:32,161
I am C-3PO, human cyborg relations.

486
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:38,000
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

487
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:42,922
My parts are showing? My goodness!

488
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:50,012
The death toll is catastrophic.

489
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:52,515
We must bow to their wishes.

490
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,684
You must contact me.

491
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:57,478
It's a trick. Send no reply.

492
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,605
Send no transmissions of any kind.

493
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:04,777
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

494
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:08,864
What if it is true, and
the people are dying?

495
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:11,450
Either way, we're running out of time.

496
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,216
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

497
00:40:27,301 --> 00:40:30,136
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

498
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,138
Move against the Jedi first.

499
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:36,976
You will then have no difficulty in taking
the queen to Naboo to sign the treaty.

500
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,312
At last we will reveal
ourselves to the Jedi.

501
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:41,814
At last we will have revenge.

502
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,817
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

503
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:47,320
They will be no match for you.

504
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:56,203
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

505
00:40:57,247 --> 00:41:00,291
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

506
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:03,919
- Any attempt to escape...
- And they blow you up!

507
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,422
How wude!

508
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,966
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

509
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:11,010
The Republic's antislavery laws...

510
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,429
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

511
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,723
We must survive on our own.

512
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,225
Xcuse me.

513
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,855
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

514
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,774
They have Podracing on Malastare.

515
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:27,610
Very fast, very dangerous.

516
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:30,279
I'm the only human who can do it.

517
00:41:30,364 --> 00:41:33,407
You must have Jedi
reflexes if you race pods.

518
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:35,910
Don't do that again.

519
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,959
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

520
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,799
- What makes you think that?
- I saw your laser sword.

521
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:52,843
Only Jedis carry that kind of weapon.

522
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:56,055
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

523
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,848
I don't think so.

524
00:41:57,933 --> 00:42:00,101
No one can kill a Jedi.

525
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:03,020
I wish that were so.

526
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:05,147
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

527
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:08,442
I came back here and freed all the slaves.

528
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:11,946
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

529
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,409
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

530
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,999
I can see there's no fooling you, Anakin.

531
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:27,128
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...

532
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:29,255
on a very important mission.

533
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:32,425
How did you end up out
here in the outer rim?

534
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:36,178
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

535
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,641
I can help. I can fix anything.

536
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,268
I believe you can.

537
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:45,187
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

538
00:42:45,272 --> 00:42:48,065
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

539
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:51,694
These junk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.

540
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:56,115
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

541
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,491
Podracing.

542
00:42:57,576 --> 00:43:00,578
Greed can be a powerful ally.

543
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:03,539
I built a racer. It's the fastest ever.

544
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,958
There's a big race tomorrow on Boonta Eve.

545
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:07,710
You could enter my pod.

546
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:12,047
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

547
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:14,049
You could make him think it was yours...

548
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:16,385
and get him to let me pilot it for you.

549
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,095
I don't want you to race. It's awful.

550
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,723
I die every time Watto makes you do it.

551
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,017
But, Mom, I love it.

552
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:26,645
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

553
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,064
Anakin.

554
00:43:29,149 --> 00:43:31,942
Your mother's right.

555
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:35,196
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

556
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:38,324
No.

557
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:48,042
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

558
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,758
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

559
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,843
We'll find some other way.

560
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:02,723
There is no other way.

561
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:07,228
I may not like it, but he can help you.

562
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:09,939
He was meant to help you.

563
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:25,371
Are you sure about this?

564
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:28,165
Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know?

565
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,292
The queen will not approve.

566
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:32,294
The queen doesn't need to know.

567
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,089
Well, I don't approve.

568
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:38,842
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

569
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:40,553
How can you do this?

570
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:43,973
Not on the Republic credits, I think.

571
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:46,267
My ship will be the entry fee.

572
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:51,564
Not bad! Not bad, huh? Nubian, huh?

573
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:54,984
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

574
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:59,071
What would the boy ride?
He smashed up my pod in the last race.

575
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:01,282
It would take some long time to fix it.

576
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:03,742
It wasn't my fault. Really.

577
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:05,536
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

578
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,998
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

579
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:12,585
That you did.

580
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:15,546
The boy's good. No doubts there, huh?

581
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,132
I have acquired a pod in a game of chance.

582
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,967
The fastest ever built.

583
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:25,180
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

584
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:30,686
So, you supply the pod and the entry fee...

585
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,229
and I supply the boy.

586
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:36,233
We split the winnings 50-50, I think, huh?

587
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:38,193
If it's going to be 50-50...

588
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:40,946
I suggest you front the cash for the entry.

589
00:45:41,031 --> 00:45:43,115
If we win...

590
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,036
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

591
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,372
And if we lose, you keep my ship.

592
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:54,251
Either way, you win.

593
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,383
Deal!

594
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:10,851
Your friend is a foolish one, methinks.

595
00:46:18,777 --> 00:46:21,737
What if this plan fails, Master?

596
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:24,573
We could be stuck here a very long time.

597
00:46:24,658 --> 00:46:27,242
Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help...

598
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:30,788
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

599
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:32,831
And...

600
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:34,833
there's something about this boy.

601
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:44,051
You should be very proud of your son.

602
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,137
He gives without any thought of reward.

603
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:50,099
He knows nothing of greed.

604
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:51,350
He has...

605
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,186
He has special powers.

606
00:46:55,939 --> 00:46:57,189
Yes.

607
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,942
He can see things before they happen.

608
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:02,903
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

609
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,863
It's a Jedi trait.

610
00:47:04,948 --> 00:47:07,825
He deserves better than a slave's life.

611
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:11,286
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

612
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:17,459
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

613
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:19,378
Who was his father?

614
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,966
There was no father.

615
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:28,762
I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him.

616
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:32,141
I can't explain what happened.

617
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,602
Can you help him?

618
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:37,604
I don't know.

619
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:43,777
I didn't actually come here to free slaves.

620
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:58,792
Wow, a real astro droid!

621
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:04,423
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

622
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:07,509
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

623
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:09,344
With this?

624
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:12,264
You're such a joker, Ani.

625
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:15,559
- You've been working on that for years.
- It's never gonna run.

626
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,895
Come on. Let's go and play ball.

627
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:21,273
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

628
00:48:29,783 --> 00:48:32,201
Keep away from those energy binders.

629
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:35,788
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

630
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:37,331
Okay.

631
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,545
My tongue is fat.

632
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:46,799
My tongue... Wrench.

633
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:49,551
Where is de wrench? Oh, dare it is.

634
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,557
I'm stuck.

635
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:59,686
You know, I find that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.

636
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:04,358
You don't even know if
this thing's gonna run.

637
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:06,568
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

638
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:08,904
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

639
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:11,114
Come on, Kitster. Let's move away.

640
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:13,408
My mouth.

641
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:14,868
Ani, I'm stuck.

642
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:22,292
My tongue is fat.

643
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:25,379
You're quite right. He's very odd indeed.

644
00:49:27,507 --> 00:49:29,591
Thank you.

645
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:31,176
Go.

646
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:49,278
It's working! It's working!

647
00:49:59,873 --> 00:50:02,416
Stay still, Ani. Let me clean this cut.

648
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,503
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

649
00:50:06,588 --> 00:50:08,463
Most of them.

650
00:50:08,548 --> 00:50:10,591
Has anyone been to 'em all?

651
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:13,468
Not likely.

652
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:16,805
I wanna be the first one to see 'em all.

653
00:50:17,974 --> 00:50:20,392
Ani, bedtime!

654
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:23,270
There we are. Good as new.

655
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:26,273
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

656
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:29,860
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

657
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:31,486
Go on.

658
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:33,572
You have a big day tomorrow.

659
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:35,574
Sleep well, Ani.

660
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:40,329
- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?

661
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:43,165
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

662
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:45,000
Wait a minute.

663
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:48,670
I need a midi-chlorian count.

664
00:50:51,633 --> 00:50:54,259
The reading is off the chart.

665
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:56,261
Over 20,000.

666
00:50:56,346 --> 00:51:00,015
Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.

667
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,934
No Jedi has.

668
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:04,144
What does that mean?

669
00:51:04,938 --> 00:51:06,605
I'm not sure.

670
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:19,428
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

671
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:21,304
Patience, my blue friend.

672
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:23,682
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

673
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:25,600
And we'll be far away from here.

674
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:29,771
Not if your ship belongs
to me, I think, huh?

675
00:52:29,856 --> 00:52:33,275
I warn you, no funny business.

676
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,528
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

677
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:39,114
I have great faith in the boy.

678
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:41,366
He's a credit to your race...

679
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:44,703
but Sebulba there is going to win, I think.

680
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:48,582
Oh, no!

681
00:52:52,712 --> 00:52:54,588
Why do you think that?

682
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,590
He always wins!

683
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:01,094
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

684
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,599
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

685
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:09,686
I'll wager my new racing
pod against, say...

686
00:53:09,771 --> 00:53:11,730
the boy and his mother.

687
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:15,567
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

688
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:18,236
The boy, then.

689
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:26,953
We'll let fate decide, huh?

690
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:30,457
I just happen to have a chance cube here.

691
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:33,627
Blue, it's the boy.

692
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:34,920
Red...

693
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:37,964
his mother.

694
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,060
You won this small toss, outlander...

695
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,312
but you won't win the race!

696
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,523
So it makes little difference!

697
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:09,246
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

698
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,502
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

699
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,003
Good morning.

700
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:21,883
Oh, my. Space travel
sounds rather perilous.

701
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:27,973
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

702
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:31,476
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

703
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:32,686
Do what?

704
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,856
Finish the race, of course.

705
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,732
You've never won a race?

706
00:54:37,817 --> 00:54:40,569
Well, not exactly.

707
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:42,696
Not even finished?

708
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,282
Kitster's right. I will this time.

709
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:47,492
Of course you will.

710
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:18,940
That's absolutely right.

711
00:55:19,025 --> 00:55:24,112
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

712
00:55:24,197 --> 00:55:27,866
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

713
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:32,787
I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund System.

714
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:40,921
Two-time winner Boles Roor.

715
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:45,258
Sebulba!

716
00:55:55,645 --> 00:55:58,772
And in the front row,
nearside pole position...

717
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:00,941
Mawhonic!

718
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:04,152
A hearty hello...

719
00:56:04,237 --> 00:56:07,989
to Clegg Holdfast and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!

720
00:56:10,952 --> 00:56:13,995
And back again, it's the mighty Dud Bolt...

721
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:18,750
with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.

722
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:24,339
And hoping for a big win today...

723
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:28,885
Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.

724
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:37,018
And a late entry, young Anakin Skywalker...

725
00:56:37,103 --> 00:56:38,436
a local boy.

726
00:56:41,107 --> 00:56:43,441
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

727
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,171
Be safe.

728
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:07,632
I will, Mom. I promise.

729
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,484
You won't walk away from this one...

730
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:28,862
you slave scum.

731
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:32,240
Don't count on it, slime ball.

732
00:57:32,325 --> 00:57:34,743
You're bantha fodder!

733
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:41,541
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

734
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,293
Right.

735
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:50,050
Remember, concentrate on the moment.

736
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:53,928
Feel, don't think. Use your instincts.

737
00:57:54,013 --> 00:57:55,680
I will.

738
00:57:55,765 --> 00:57:58,058
May the Force be with you.

739
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:09,027
Jabba the Hutt.

740
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:22,832
Welcome.

741
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:27,462
Begin the race!

742
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:41,601
Hey, looks like they're clearing the grid.

743
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,646
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

744
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:49,192
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not...

745
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:52,195
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

746
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:54,531
You should too.

747
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:56,741
You assume too much.

748
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:59,869
Start your engines.

749
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:42,495
Oh, dissen gonna be messy. Me no watch'n!

750
01:00:02,475 --> 01:00:03,850
Oh, no!

751
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:12,734
Wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.

752
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:27,415
It looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.

753
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:30,335
Come on, Ani!

754
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:38,343
And there goes Skywalker!

755
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:39,886
Go, Ani, go!

756
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,180
He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.

757
01:01:56,213 --> 01:02:01,634
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out on the canyon dune turn.

758
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:16,524
There goes Quadinaros' power coupling.

759
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:46,512
Oh, no!

760
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:53,186
Where is Master Anakin?

761
01:02:56,357 --> 01:02:58,650
Look. Here he comes.

762
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:03,863
It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.

763
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:06,157
Yay! Yippee!

764
01:03:13,582 --> 01:03:17,210
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

765
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:26,654
Skywalker's spinning out of control!

766
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:28,549
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

767
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:36,808
Here he comes!

768
01:05:36,892 --> 01:05:40,603
At the start of the third and final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead...

769
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:43,189
followed closely by Skywalker!

770
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:44,190
Go, Ani!

771
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:13,553
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

772
01:06:35,242 --> 01:06:36,617
It's Skywalker!

773
01:06:37,578 --> 01:06:38,911
Sebulba!

774
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:43,332
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

775
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:45,209
Did he crash-ed?

776
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:29,337
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

777
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:24,058
He's catching Sebulba!

778
01:08:25,102 --> 01:08:27,687
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

779
01:08:57,968 --> 01:09:00,428
That little human being is out of his mind!

780
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:02,722
They're side by side!

781
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:33,252
- Yippee!
- Yay!

782
01:09:37,424 --> 01:09:39,175
I can't believe it.

783
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:41,260
The crowds are going nuts!

784
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:52,188
Yay, Ani!

785
01:09:53,482 --> 01:09:56,567
Mom, I did it! Yay!

786
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:08,954
Good going, Ani!

787
01:10:13,293 --> 01:10:15,294
We owe you everything, Ani.

788
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:20,007
It's so wonderful, Ani.

789
01:10:20,092 --> 01:10:22,843
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

790
01:10:22,928 --> 01:10:25,805
I'm so very proud of you.

791
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:37,525
You!

792
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:39,985
You swindled me.

793
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:43,906
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehow you knew it.

794
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,908
I lost everything.

795
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:49,578
Whenever you gamble, my friend,
eventually you lose.

796
01:10:49,663 --> 01:10:52,164
Bring the parts to the main hangar.

797
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:55,334
I'll come by your shop later on
so you can release the boy.

798
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:58,796
You can't have him. It wasn't a fair bet.

799
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:05,010
Would you like to discuss
it with the Hutts?

800
01:11:05,095 --> 01:11:07,638
I'm sure they can settle this.

801
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:11,016
Take him.

802
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:19,024
Hidoe!

803
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,778
Well, we have all the
essential parts we need.

804
01:11:22,863 --> 01:11:23,863
I'm going back.

805
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:26,073
Some unfinished business. I won't be long.

806
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:29,702
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

807
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:33,622
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

808
01:11:33,707 --> 01:11:35,624
Get this hyperdrive generator installed.

809
01:11:35,709 --> 01:11:38,294
Yes, Master. That shouldn't take long.

810
01:11:38,378 --> 01:11:40,546
Come on. Hup!

811
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:47,094
Hey. These are yours.

812
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,347
Yes!

813
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:54,643
Mom, we sold the pod!
Look at all the money we have!

814
01:11:54,728 --> 01:11:57,146
My goodness! But that's so wonderful, Ani.

815
01:11:57,230 --> 01:12:00,232
- And he has been freed.
- What?

816
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:02,109
You're no longer a slave.

817
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:05,946
Did you hear that?

818
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:09,241
Now you can make your
dreams come true, Ani.

819
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:12,036
You are free.

820
01:12:15,582 --> 01:12:17,041
Will you take him with you?

821
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:18,834
Is he to become a Jedi?

822
01:12:18,919 --> 01:12:21,462
Yes. Our meeting was not a coincidence.

823
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:24,006
Nothing happens by accident.

824
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:27,676
You mean I get to come with you
in your starship?

825
01:12:27,761 --> 01:12:29,261
Anakin...

826
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:34,433
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge...

827
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:37,394
and even if you succeed, it's a hard life.

828
01:12:37,479 --> 01:12:40,731
But I wanna go. It's what
I've always dreamed of doing.

829
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:43,651
Can I go, Mom?

830
01:12:44,611 --> 01:12:46,362
Anakin...

831
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:49,365
this path has been placed before you.

832
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:51,951
The choice is yours alone.

833
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:57,456
I wanna do it.

834
01:12:59,501 --> 01:13:02,294
Then pack your things.
We haven't much time.

835
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:10,469
What about Mom?

836
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:15,474
Is she free too?

837
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:19,144
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

838
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:22,147
You're coming with us, aren't you, Mom?

839
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:33,450
Son, my place is here. My future is here.

840
01:13:33,535 --> 01:13:35,995
It is time for you to let go.

841
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:39,248
I don't want things to change.

842
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:41,750
But you can't stop the change...

843
01:13:41,835 --> 01:13:45,004
any more than you can
stop the suns from setting.

844
01:13:46,006 --> 01:13:48,007
I love you.

845
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:55,514
Now hurry.

846
01:14:01,021 --> 01:14:02,438
Thank you.

847
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:05,524
I'll watch after him. You have my word.

848
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:09,236
Will you be all right?

849
01:14:10,697 --> 01:14:12,156
Yeah.

850
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:18,787
Hello, Master Anakin.

851
01:14:18,872 --> 01:14:20,998
Well, 3PO, I've been freed...

852
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:23,500
and I'm going away in a starship.

853
01:14:23,585 --> 01:14:26,503
Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.

854
01:14:26,588 --> 01:14:30,841
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.

855
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:34,136
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to finish you, 3PO...

856
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,305
give you coverings and all.

857
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:38,015
I'm gonna miss working on you.

858
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:40,642
You've been a great pal.

859
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:43,395
I'll make sure Mom
doesn't sell you or anything.

860
01:14:44,147 --> 01:14:45,189
Sell me?

861
01:14:45,273 --> 01:14:46,940
Bye.

862
01:14:47,025 --> 01:14:48,484
Oh, my.

863
01:15:13,093 --> 01:15:15,302
I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.

864
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:21,600
Will I ever see you again?

865
01:15:23,103 --> 01:15:25,938
What does your heart tell you?

866
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,274
I hope so.

867
01:15:29,943 --> 01:15:31,860
Yes.

868
01:15:31,945 --> 01:15:33,570
I guess.

869
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:37,199
Then we will see each other again.

870
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:42,704
I will come back and free you, Mom.

871
01:15:42,789 --> 01:15:44,498
I promise.

872
01:15:52,799 --> 01:15:55,759
Now, be brave...

873
01:15:56,511 --> 01:15:58,512
and don't look back.

874
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:01,223
Don't look back.

875
01:16:45,727 --> 01:16:47,644
Qui-Gon, sir, wait! I'm tired!

876
01:16:47,729 --> 01:16:48,729
Anakin! Drop!

877
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:52,191
Go!

878
01:16:53,193 --> 01:16:55,194
Tell them to take off!

879
01:17:07,707 --> 01:17:09,208
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

880
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:11,877
Take off.

881
01:17:12,504 --> 01:17:14,338
Over there. Fly low.

882
01:17:35,902 --> 01:17:38,987
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

883
01:17:39,072 --> 01:17:40,656
What was it?

884
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,491
I'm not sure...

885
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:45,327
but it was well-trained in the Jedi arts.

886
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,746
My guess is it was after the queen.

887
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:50,415
What are we gonna do about it?

888
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:54,002
We shall be patient.

889
01:17:54,087 --> 01:17:55,212
Anakin Skywalker...

890
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:57,589
meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

891
01:17:59,509 --> 01:18:02,135
You're a Jedi too? Pleased to meet you.

892
01:18:11,104 --> 01:18:13,689
Your queen is lost,
your people are starving...

893
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:15,774
and you, Governor, are going to die...

894
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:18,026
much sooner than your people, I'm afraid.

895
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,696
This invasion will gain you nothing.

896
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:23,782
We're a democracy. The people have decided.

897
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:25,784
Take him away.

898
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:31,707
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

899
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:34,376
for these rumored underwater villages.

900
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:37,129
They will not stay hidden for long.

901
01:18:48,141 --> 01:18:50,892
The death toll is catastrophic.

902
01:18:50,977 --> 01:18:53,604
We must bow to their wishes.

903
01:18:53,688 --> 01:18:55,981
You must contact me.

904
01:19:10,038 --> 01:19:11,997
You all right?

905
01:19:13,041 --> 01:19:15,000
It's very cold.

906
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:25,761
You come from a warm planet, Ani.

907
01:19:25,845 --> 01:19:28,263
A little too warm for my taste.

908
01:19:28,348 --> 01:19:30,557
Space is cold.

909
01:19:30,642 --> 01:19:32,851
You seem sad.

910
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:36,271
The queen is worried.

911
01:19:36,356 --> 01:19:38,732
Her people are suffering, dying.

912
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:42,402
She must convince the senate
to intervene or...

913
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:46,198
I'm not sure what'll happen.

914
01:19:47,617 --> 01:19:49,701
I made this for you...

915
01:19:51,204 --> 01:19:53,038
so you'd remember me.

916
01:19:53,748 --> 01:19:56,458
I carved it out of a japor snippet.

917
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:59,378
It'll bring you good fortune.

918
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:01,463
It's beautiful.

919
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:03,882
But I don't need this to remember you by.

920
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:10,972
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani...

921
01:20:11,057 --> 01:20:13,642
but my caring for you will remain.

922
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:19,481
I care for you, too, only I...

923
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:21,733
Miss your mother.

924
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:44,381
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

925
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:46,258
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

926
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:49,636
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

927
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:22,169
It is a great gift
to see you alive, Your Majesty.

928
01:21:22,253 --> 01:21:25,297
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

929
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,883
I'm anxious to hear your report
on the situation.

930
01:21:27,967 --> 01:21:30,635
May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

931
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,721
Welcome, Your Highness.

932
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:34,848
It's an honor to finally
meet you in person.

933
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:36,475
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.

934
01:21:36,559 --> 01:21:40,103
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

935
01:21:40,188 --> 01:21:43,648
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.

936
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:47,903
I'm grateful for your concern, Chancellor.

937
01:21:47,987 --> 01:21:49,905
There is a question of procedure...

938
01:21:49,989 --> 01:21:52,491
but I'm confident we can overcome it.

939
01:21:53,326 --> 01:21:55,494
I must speak with the
Jedi Council immediately.

940
01:21:55,578 --> 01:21:58,455
The situation has become
much more complicated.

941
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:06,129
Ani, come on.

942
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:20,060
Da queen's a bein grossly nice, mesa tinks.

943
01:22:21,354 --> 01:22:23,355
Pitty hot.

944
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:54,386
There is no civility, only politics.

945
01:22:55,638 --> 01:22:59,558
The Republic is not what it once was.

946
01:22:59,642 --> 01:23:04,896
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

947
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:09,109
There is no interest in the common good.

948
01:23:09,986 --> 01:23:11,653
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

949
01:23:11,737 --> 01:23:14,489
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.

950
01:23:14,574 --> 01:23:17,325
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

951
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:21,663
If I may say so, Your Majesty,
the chancellor has little real power.

952
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:25,667
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

953
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:29,546
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

954
01:23:30,256 --> 01:23:33,174
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

955
01:23:33,259 --> 01:23:35,510
of a stronger supreme chancellor...

956
01:23:35,595 --> 01:23:37,762
one who could control the bureaucrats...

957
01:23:37,847 --> 01:23:39,764
and give us justice.

958
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:46,104
You could call for a vote of
no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.

959
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:48,732
He has been our strongest supporter.

960
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:54,070
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.

961
01:23:54,155 --> 01:23:57,574
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.

962
01:23:58,451 --> 01:24:00,577
Our people are dying, Senator.

963
01:24:01,329 --> 01:24:04,372
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

964
01:24:04,457 --> 01:24:07,042
To be realistic, Your Majesty...

965
01:24:07,126 --> 01:24:09,586
I think we're going to have to
accept Federation control...

966
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:12,255
for the time being.

967
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:16,134
That is something I cannot do.

968
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:25,977
He was trained in the Jedi arts.

969
01:24:26,062 --> 01:24:30,023
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

970
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:31,566
Impossible.

971
01:24:31,651 --> 01:24:34,319
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.

972
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:38,657
I do not believe the Sith could
have returned without us knowing.

973
01:24:39,659 --> 01:24:41,826
Hard to see, the dark side is.

974
01:24:41,911 --> 01:24:44,829
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

975
01:24:44,914 --> 01:24:48,249
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

976
01:24:48,334 --> 01:24:50,001
May the Force be with you.

977
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:55,507
Master Qui-Gon.

978
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:58,176
More to say have you?

979
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:02,180
With your permission, my master...

980
01:25:03,683 --> 01:25:06,685
I have encountered a vergence in the Force.

981
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:09,813
A vergence, you say.

982
01:25:09,897 --> 01:25:12,065
Located around a person?

983
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:13,483
A boy.

984
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:16,111
His cells have the highest
concentration of midi-chlorians...

985
01:25:16,195 --> 01:25:17,988
I have seen in a life-form.

986
01:25:18,072 --> 01:25:21,032
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

987
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:26,579
You refer to the prophecy of the one
who will bring balance to the Force.

988
01:25:27,373 --> 01:25:29,499
You believe it's this boy?

989
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:32,210
- I don't presume to...
- But you do.

990
01:25:32,962 --> 01:25:34,963
Revealed your opinion is.

991
01:25:35,047 --> 01:25:37,090
I request the boy be tested, Master.

992
01:25:39,218 --> 01:25:42,429
Trained as a Jedi you request for him, hmm?

993
01:25:42,513 --> 01:25:44,973
Finding him was the will of the Force.

994
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:47,350
I have no doubt of that.

995
01:25:53,983 --> 01:25:56,067
Bring him before us, then.

996
01:26:07,121 --> 01:26:09,039
The boy's here to see Padmé.

997
01:26:09,123 --> 01:26:10,749
Let him in.

998
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:17,839
I'm sorry, Ani, but Padmé's
not here right now.

999
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:19,632
Who is it?

1000
01:26:19,717 --> 01:26:23,428
Anakin Skywalker to see
Padmé, Your Highness.

1001
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:25,346
I've sent Padmé on an errand.

1002
01:26:25,431 --> 01:26:27,307
I'm on my way to the Jedi temple...

1003
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:29,768
to start my training, I hope.

1004
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:34,397
I may never see her again,
so I came to say good-bye.

1005
01:26:35,441 --> 01:26:39,110
We will tell her for you.
We are sure her heart goes with you.

1006
01:26:40,196 --> 01:26:41,279
Thank you, Your Highness.

1007
01:26:55,211 --> 01:26:59,339
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

1008
01:27:06,138 --> 01:27:09,557
Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate...

1009
01:27:10,601 --> 01:27:13,019
a tragedy has occurred...

1010
01:27:13,104 --> 01:27:16,648
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

1011
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:19,776
and has now engulfed our entire planet...

1012
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,945
in the oppression of the Trade Federation.

1013
01:27:22,822 --> 01:27:24,239
This is outrageous!

1014
01:27:24,323 --> 01:27:26,908
I object to the senator's statements.

1015
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:31,079
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

1016
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:35,083
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala...

1017
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:37,168
recently elected ruler of the Naboo...

1018
01:27:37,253 --> 01:27:39,212
who speaks on our behalf.

1019
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:48,012
Honorable representatives
of the Republic...

1020
01:27:48,681 --> 01:27:51,182
I come to you under the gravest
of circumstances.

1021
01:27:51,267 --> 01:27:54,185
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade...

1022
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:57,814
I object! There is no proof!

1023
01:27:57,898 --> 01:27:59,858
This is incredible.

1024
01:27:59,942 --> 01:28:03,945
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

1025
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:05,363
The Congress of Malastare...

1026
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:08,491
concurs with the honorable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1027
01:28:08,576 --> 01:28:10,660
A commission must be appointed.

1028
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:13,288
- The point...
- Excuse me, Chancellor.

1029
01:28:13,372 --> 01:28:14,998
Enter the bureaucrat.

1030
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:17,792
The true rulers of the Republic.

1031
01:28:17,877 --> 01:28:22,046
And on the payroll
of the Trade Federation, I might add.

1032
01:28:22,131 --> 01:28:26,426
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

1033
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:30,305
The point is conceded.

1034
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:33,057
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission...

1035
01:28:33,142 --> 01:28:35,935
to explore the validity of your accusations?

1036
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:37,979
I will not defer.

1037
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:41,566
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.

1038
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:44,694
I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...

1039
01:28:44,778 --> 01:28:47,530
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1040
01:28:50,451 --> 01:28:52,827
If this body is not capable of action...

1041
01:28:52,912 --> 01:28:54,996
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1042
01:28:58,417 --> 01:29:00,668
I move for a vote of no confidence...

1043
01:29:00,753 --> 01:29:02,754
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

1044
01:29:09,762 --> 01:29:11,930
Vote now! Vote now!

1045
01:29:15,768 --> 01:29:17,685
Order!

1046
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:20,688
Now they will elect a new chancellor...

1047
01:29:20,773 --> 01:29:22,690
a strong chancellor...

1048
01:29:22,775 --> 01:29:25,777
one who will not let our tragedy continue.

1049
01:29:27,446 --> 01:29:31,699
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

1050
01:29:31,784 --> 01:29:34,953
Anakin will become a Jedi, I promise you.

1051
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:37,747
Do not defy the council, Master, not again.

1052
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:40,625
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1053
01:29:42,503 --> 01:29:46,297
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

1054
01:29:46,382 --> 01:29:48,466
They will not go along with you this time.

1055
01:29:49,969 --> 01:29:52,553
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

1056
01:29:55,808 --> 01:29:57,183
A ship.

1057
01:29:58,811 --> 01:30:00,770
A cup.

1058
01:30:00,854 --> 01:30:02,689
A ship.

1059
01:30:03,816 --> 01:30:05,316
A speeder.

1060
01:30:12,825 --> 01:30:14,784
How feel you?

1061
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:16,995
Cold, sir.

1062
01:30:18,664 --> 01:30:20,832
- Afraid are you?
- No, sir.

1063
01:30:22,001 --> 01:30:24,627
See through you we can.

1064
01:30:24,712 --> 01:30:26,629
Be mindful of your feelings.

1065
01:30:26,714 --> 01:30:29,507
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1066
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:32,677
I miss her.

1067
01:30:33,804 --> 01:30:36,306
Afraid to lose her, I think, mmm?

1068
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:38,599
What has that got to do with anything?

1069
01:30:38,684 --> 01:30:41,060
Everything.

1070
01:30:41,145 --> 01:30:44,230
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1071
01:30:44,315 --> 01:30:47,233
Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate.

1072
01:30:47,318 --> 01:30:50,695
Hate leads to suffering.

1073
01:30:57,202 --> 01:31:00,163
I sense much fear in you.

1074
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:16,471
Yousa tinking yousa people ganna die?

1075
01:31:16,555 --> 01:31:17,889
I don't know.

1076
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:21,100
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1077
01:31:23,562 --> 01:31:25,605
I hope not.

1078
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:28,649
Gungans no die'n without a fight.

1079
01:31:28,734 --> 01:31:30,651
Wesa warriors.

1080
01:31:30,736 --> 01:31:33,988
Wesa got a grand army.

1081
01:31:34,073 --> 01:31:37,325
Dat's why you no liken us, mesa tinks.

1082
01:31:37,409 --> 01:31:38,785
Your Highness?

1083
01:31:41,413 --> 01:31:43,623
Your Highness...

1084
01:31:43,707 --> 01:31:46,834
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

1085
01:31:46,919 --> 01:31:48,336
as supreme chancellor.

1086
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:52,340
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.

1087
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:56,844
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1088
01:31:56,929 --> 01:31:58,596
Who else has been nominated?

1089
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:03,017
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1090
01:32:03,102 --> 01:32:08,106
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1091
01:32:09,775 --> 01:32:11,776
I will be chancellor.

1092
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:14,529
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats, Senator...

1093
01:32:14,613 --> 01:32:17,865
there'll be nothing left
of our people, our way of life.

1094
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:19,867
I understand your concern, Your Majesty.

1095
01:32:19,952 --> 01:32:23,496
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1096
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:29,127
Senator, this is your arena.

1097
01:32:29,795 --> 01:32:31,421
I feel I must return to mine.

1098
01:32:34,633 --> 01:32:36,926
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1099
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:37,927
Go back?

1100
01:32:38,011 --> 01:32:41,013
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1101
01:32:41,098 --> 01:32:43,558
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1102
01:32:43,642 --> 01:32:46,436
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1103
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:48,146
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

1104
01:32:48,230 --> 01:32:50,565
- Ready my ship.
- Please, Your Majesty.

1105
01:32:50,649 --> 01:32:52,608
Stay here where it's safe.

1106
01:32:54,027 --> 01:32:57,280
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.

1107
01:32:57,990 --> 01:33:02,160
I pray you will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.

1108
01:33:11,837 --> 01:33:14,422
The Force is strong with him.

1109
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:16,507
He is to be trained, then?

1110
01:33:18,552 --> 01:33:20,970
No, he will not be trained.

1111
01:33:21,054 --> 01:33:22,805
No?

1112
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:26,851
He is too old.

1113
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:30,813
He is the chosen one. You must see it.

1114
01:33:31,899 --> 01:33:35,526
Clouded this boy's future is.

1115
01:33:37,696 --> 01:33:39,530
I will train him, then.

1116
01:33:43,869 --> 01:33:46,704
I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.

1117
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:49,790
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

1118
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:52,251
Impossible to take on a second.

1119
01:33:52,336 --> 01:33:54,045
The code forbids it.

1120
01:33:54,129 --> 01:33:57,548
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

1121
01:33:57,633 --> 01:34:01,344
Our own counsel we will
keep on who is ready.

1122
01:34:02,262 --> 01:34:05,181
He is headstrong and he has much
to learn of the living Force...

1123
01:34:05,265 --> 01:34:06,766
but he is capable.

1124
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:08,893
There is little more he can learn from me.

1125
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:15,316
Young Skywalker's fate
will be decided later.

1126
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,027
Now is not the time for this.

1127
01:34:18,737 --> 01:34:20,738
The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor...

1128
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:23,533
and Queen Amidala is returning home...

1129
01:34:23,617 --> 01:34:26,869
which puts pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.

1130
01:34:26,954 --> 01:34:29,288
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1131
01:34:29,373 --> 01:34:33,793
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

1132
01:34:35,045 --> 01:34:36,671
This is the clue we need...

1133
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:39,382
to unravel the mystery of the Sith.

1134
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:42,260
May the Force be with you.

1135
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:58,359
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1136
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:00,361
From your point of view.

1137
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:03,864
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1138
01:35:03,949 --> 01:35:06,867
His fate is uncertain. He's not dangerous.

1139
01:35:06,952 --> 01:35:09,370
The council will decide Anakin's future.

1140
01:35:09,454 --> 01:35:12,415
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.

1141
01:35:18,005 --> 01:35:21,841
Qui-Gon, sir, I don't want to be a problem.

1142
01:35:21,925 --> 01:35:24,176
You won't be, Ani.

1143
01:35:24,261 --> 01:35:26,220
I'm not allowed to train you...

1144
01:35:26,305 --> 01:35:28,347
so I want you to watch me and be mindful.

1145
01:35:28,432 --> 01:35:30,600
Always remember:

1146
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:34,103
Your focus determines your reality.

1147
01:35:34,187 --> 01:35:37,857
Stay close to me and you'll be safe.

1148
01:35:37,941 --> 01:35:39,317
Master, sir...

1149
01:35:39,401 --> 01:35:43,029
I heard Yoda talking about midi-chlorians.

1150
01:35:43,113 --> 01:35:46,657
I've been wondering...
What are midi-chlorians?

1151
01:35:47,951 --> 01:35:50,369
Midi-chlorians are a
microscopic life-form...

1152
01:35:50,454 --> 01:35:52,705
that resides within all living cells.

1153
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:57,043
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.

1154
01:35:57,127 --> 01:36:00,630
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

1155
01:36:00,714 --> 01:36:04,634
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1156
01:36:04,718 --> 01:36:07,637
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...

1157
01:36:07,721 --> 01:36:10,598
and we would have no
knowledge of the Force.

1158
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:12,558
They continually speak to us...

1159
01:36:12,643 --> 01:36:15,353
telling us the will of the Force.

1160
01:36:15,437 --> 01:36:17,605
When you learn to quiet your mind...

1161
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:19,607
you'll hear them speaking to you.

1162
01:36:19,691 --> 01:36:21,609
I don't understand.

1163
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:25,196
With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.

1164
01:36:29,201 --> 01:36:33,037
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.

1165
01:36:33,705 --> 01:36:35,122
I welcome your help.

1166
01:36:35,207 --> 01:36:38,959
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.

1167
01:36:39,044 --> 01:36:42,088
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

1168
01:36:42,172 --> 01:36:45,132
Wesa goin' home!

1169
01:36:45,217 --> 01:36:47,093
Come on, R2.

1170
01:36:57,354 --> 01:36:59,730
Is the planet secure?

1171
01:36:59,815 --> 01:37:03,776
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1172
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:06,987
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1173
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:10,282
Good. I will see to it
that in the senate...

1174
01:37:10,367 --> 01:37:13,327
things stay as they are.

1175
01:37:13,412 --> 01:37:16,956
I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.

1176
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,958
Yes, my lord.

1177
01:37:19,042 --> 01:37:20,918
A Sith here?

1178
01:37:26,299 --> 01:37:28,801
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1179
01:37:28,885 --> 01:37:31,303
And those two control the pitch?

1180
01:37:32,889 --> 01:37:34,765
You catch on pretty quick.

1181
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:36,684
As soon as we land...

1182
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:39,395
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1183
01:37:39,479 --> 01:37:40,604
I agree.

1184
01:37:40,689 --> 01:37:43,441
I'm not sure what you wish
to accomplish by this.

1185
01:37:43,525 --> 01:37:46,068
I will take back what's ours.

1186
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:48,988
There are too few of us, Your Highness.

1187
01:37:49,072 --> 01:37:51,031
We have no army.

1188
01:37:51,116 --> 01:37:52,575
And I can only protect you.

1189
01:37:52,659 --> 01:37:54,660
I can't fight a war for you.

1190
01:37:55,662 --> 01:37:56,787
Jar Jar Binks.

1191
01:37:57,622 --> 01:37:59,874
Mesa, Your Highness?

1192
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:02,918
Yes. I need your help.

1193
01:38:08,091 --> 01:38:10,342
I have one battleship on my scope.

1194
01:38:10,427 --> 01:38:12,553
It's a droid control ship.

1195
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:14,889
They've probably spotted us.

1196
01:38:14,973 --> 01:38:16,682
We haven't much time.

1197
01:38:28,361 --> 01:38:31,071
Jar Jar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.

1198
01:38:31,156 --> 01:38:32,531
Good.

1199
01:38:32,616 --> 01:38:34,909
Do you think the queen's idea will work?

1200
01:38:34,993 --> 01:38:36,660
The Gungans will not be easily swayed.

1201
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:41,040
And we cannot use our power to help her.

1202
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:45,920
I'm sorry for my behavior, Master.

1203
01:38:46,004 --> 01:38:49,799
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.

1204
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:55,012
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1205
01:38:56,139 --> 01:38:58,015
You've been a good apprentice, Obi-Wan.

1206
01:38:59,476 --> 01:39:02,186
And you're a much wiser man than I am.

1207
01:39:02,854 --> 01:39:06,190
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

1208
01:39:19,204 --> 01:39:21,580
Desa nobody dare!

1209
01:39:21,665 --> 01:39:23,874
The Gungan city is deserted!

1210
01:39:23,959 --> 01:39:26,544
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1211
01:39:26,628 --> 01:39:29,797
Do you think they have been taken
to the camps?

1212
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:32,216
More likely they were wiped out.

1213
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:35,386
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are, Jar Jar?

1214
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:38,931
When in trouble, Gungans
go to sacred place.

1215
01:39:39,015 --> 01:39:41,934
Mesa show you. Come on. Mesa show you!

1216
01:40:00,245 --> 01:40:03,914
Your Honor, Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1217
01:40:10,547 --> 01:40:13,924
Heyo dadee Big Boss Nass, Your Honor.

1218
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:17,094
Jar Jar Binks.

1219
01:40:17,178 --> 01:40:20,890
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1220
01:40:21,433 --> 01:40:23,767
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1221
01:40:24,561 --> 01:40:27,021
I come before you in peace.

1222
01:40:27,105 --> 01:40:29,940
Ah, Naboo biggen.

1223
01:40:30,025 --> 01:40:33,235
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1224
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:37,114
Yousa all bombad.

1225
01:40:37,949 --> 01:40:40,826
We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.

1226
01:40:40,911 --> 01:40:42,286
Your Honor.

1227
01:40:44,456 --> 01:40:47,416
Whosa dis?

1228
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,793
I am Queen Amidala.

1229
01:40:51,379 --> 01:40:53,047
This is my decoy...

1230
01:40:53,131 --> 01:40:56,759
my protection, my loyal bodyguard.

1231
01:40:56,843 --> 01:41:01,180
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

1232
01:41:01,264 --> 01:41:03,891
Although we do not always agree,
Your Honor...

1233
01:41:03,975 --> 01:41:06,518
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1234
01:41:08,271 --> 01:41:11,482
The Trade Federation has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1235
01:41:11,566 --> 01:41:14,902
If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1236
01:41:14,986 --> 01:41:17,237
I ask you to help us.

1237
01:41:17,322 --> 01:41:20,074
No, I beg you to help us.

1238
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:22,534
We are your humble servants.

1239
01:41:25,789 --> 01:41:28,624
Our fate is in your hands.

1240
01:41:45,767 --> 01:41:50,062
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?

1241
01:41:52,524 --> 01:41:56,485
Mesa lika dis!

1242
01:41:57,362 --> 01:41:58,362
Maybe...

1243
01:41:58,446 --> 01:42:01,073
wesa...

1244
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:03,033
being friends.

1245
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:13,544
We've sent our patrols.

1246
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:17,131
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1247
01:42:17,215 --> 01:42:19,425
It won't be long, my lord.

1248
01:42:19,509 --> 01:42:22,678
This is an unexpected move for her.

1249
01:42:22,762 --> 01:42:24,805
It's too aggressive.

1250
01:42:24,889 --> 01:42:27,349
Lord Maul, be mindful.

1251
01:42:27,434 --> 01:42:30,019
Let them make the first move.

1252
01:42:30,103 --> 01:42:32,062
Yes, my master.

1253
01:42:35,567 --> 01:42:37,234
Deysa comin!

1254
01:42:37,318 --> 01:42:38,736
All right!

1255
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:43,991
They're here!

1256
01:42:44,075 --> 01:42:45,534
Good. They made it.

1257
01:42:50,081 --> 01:42:52,791
Yousa doen grand.

1258
01:42:52,876 --> 01:42:56,003
Jar Jar bring uss-en and da Naboo together.

1259
01:42:56,087 --> 01:42:58,005
Oh, no, no, no.

1260
01:42:58,089 --> 01:43:01,050
So, wesa make you...

1261
01:43:01,134 --> 01:43:03,677
bombad general.

1262
01:43:03,762 --> 01:43:05,262
General?

1263
01:43:08,266 --> 01:43:09,808
Captain.

1264
01:43:09,893 --> 01:43:12,519
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?

1265
01:43:12,604 --> 01:43:14,521
Almost everyone's in camps.

1266
01:43:14,606 --> 01:43:17,858
A few hundred police and guards have formed
an underground resistance movement.

1267
01:43:17,942 --> 01:43:20,527
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.

1268
01:43:20,612 --> 01:43:23,530
The Federation army's also
much larger than we thought...

1269
01:43:23,615 --> 01:43:25,282
and much stronger.

1270
01:43:26,576 --> 01:43:29,703
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1271
01:43:29,788 --> 01:43:32,039
The battle is a diversion.

1272
01:43:32,123 --> 01:43:35,000
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1273
01:43:35,085 --> 01:43:36,668
R2.

1274
01:43:37,754 --> 01:43:41,256
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1275
01:43:41,341 --> 01:43:43,092
Once we get to the main entrance...

1276
01:43:43,176 --> 01:43:46,303
Captain Panaka will create a diversion.

1277
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:49,348
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1278
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:52,893
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1279
01:43:52,977 --> 01:43:54,728
What do you think, Master Jedi?

1280
01:43:54,813 --> 01:43:56,980
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1281
01:43:57,065 --> 01:43:59,608
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

1282
01:43:59,692 --> 01:44:02,027
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1283
01:44:02,112 --> 01:44:06,865
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1284
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:10,285
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1285
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:13,580
We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.

1286
01:44:13,665 --> 01:44:15,582
We will send what pilots we have...

1287
01:44:15,667 --> 01:44:18,710
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1288
01:44:18,795 --> 01:44:21,922
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1289
01:44:22,006 --> 01:44:25,134
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1290
01:44:25,218 --> 01:44:26,927
There's an even bigger danger.

1291
01:44:27,011 --> 01:44:28,929
If the viceroy escapes, Your Highness...

1292
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:31,265
he will return with another droid army.

1293
01:44:31,349 --> 01:44:34,601
Well, that is why we must not fail
to get the viceroy.

1294
01:44:34,686 --> 01:44:36,645
Everything depends on it.

1295
01:44:41,943 --> 01:44:44,611
She is more foolish than I thought.

1296
01:44:44,696 --> 01:44:49,658
We are sending all troops to meet
this army assembling near the swamp.

1297
01:44:49,742 --> 01:44:52,452
It appears to be made up of primitives.

1298
01:44:52,537 --> 01:44:55,122
This will work to our advantage.

1299
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:58,041
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord?

1300
01:44:58,793 --> 01:45:00,544
Wipe them out.

1301
01:45:02,213 --> 01:45:04,131
All of them.

1302
01:45:34,954 --> 01:45:36,413
Halt!

1303
01:45:39,792 --> 01:45:42,085
Starting up the shield.

1304
01:46:11,616 --> 01:46:12,824
Open fire.

1305
01:46:28,967 --> 01:46:32,219
Once we get inside, you find
a safe place to hide and stay there.

1306
01:46:32,303 --> 01:46:34,221
- Sure.
- Stay there.

1307
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:52,281
Roger, roger.

1308
01:47:00,248 --> 01:47:03,375
I thought the battle was going
to take place far from here.

1309
01:47:04,502 --> 01:47:06,003
This is too close.

1310
01:47:11,843 --> 01:47:14,344
Ani, find cover.

1311
01:47:14,429 --> 01:47:16,763
- Quick!
- Get to your ships!

1312
01:48:15,448 --> 01:48:16,656
Fighters straight ahead.

1313
01:48:16,741 --> 01:48:17,866
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1314
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:19,242
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1315
01:48:27,919 --> 01:48:28,960
Cease fire.

1316
01:48:36,511 --> 01:48:38,970
Steady. Steady.

1317
01:49:12,046 --> 01:49:15,298
- Activate the droids.
- Yes, sir.

1318
01:49:31,816 --> 01:49:33,692
Ouch time.

1319
01:49:47,790 --> 01:49:48,957
Fire!

1320
01:50:11,189 --> 01:50:13,023
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1321
01:50:13,107 --> 01:50:14,608
Red group! Blue group!

1322
01:50:14,692 --> 01:50:16,526
Everybody, this way!

1323
01:50:16,611 --> 01:50:18,653
Hey, wait for me!

1324
01:50:18,738 --> 01:50:21,156
Anakin, stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.

1325
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:23,366
- But I...
- Stay in that cockpit.

1326
01:50:35,421 --> 01:50:38,715
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1327
01:50:58,861 --> 01:51:00,862
We gotta do something, R2.

1328
01:51:23,594 --> 01:51:26,596
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

1329
01:51:30,101 --> 01:51:33,103
Oops, wrong one. Maybe it's this one.

1330
01:51:34,230 --> 01:51:36,606
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1331
01:51:38,776 --> 01:51:39,776
Yeah!

1332
01:51:45,116 --> 01:51:46,658
Let's go!

1333
01:51:47,702 --> 01:51:49,953
It's on automatic pilot.

1334
01:51:59,005 --> 01:52:00,964
Try to override it.

1335
01:53:01,025 --> 01:53:02,901
We don't have time for this, Captain.

1336
01:53:09,033 --> 01:53:10,909
Look, there they are.

1337
01:53:10,993 --> 01:53:13,370
That's where the autopilot's taking us.

1338
01:53:30,388 --> 01:53:33,014
Dumb droid. Take that!

1339
01:53:33,099 --> 01:53:35,100
Get off! Get off! Get off!

1340
01:53:35,184 --> 01:53:36,393
Get off!

1341
01:53:46,404 --> 01:53:48,780
The deflector shield is too strong.

1342
01:53:58,082 --> 01:53:59,791
This is tense!

1343
01:54:02,044 --> 01:54:04,087
R2, get us off this autopilot.

1344
01:54:04,171 --> 01:54:06,089
It's gonna get us both killed.

1345
01:54:07,717 --> 01:54:10,176
You did it, R2!

1346
01:54:10,261 --> 01:54:11,469
Let's go left.

1347
01:54:16,642 --> 01:54:17,851
Go back?

1348
01:54:17,935 --> 01:54:22,272
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1349
01:54:29,113 --> 01:54:31,614
I'll try spinning. That's a good trick.

1350
01:54:37,246 --> 01:54:39,789
I know we're in trouble. Just hang on.

1351
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:47,672
Go!

1352
01:54:52,470 --> 01:54:54,262
Ascension guns!

1353
01:57:00,306 --> 01:57:01,973
Retreat! Retreat!

1354
01:57:03,726 --> 01:57:05,643
Dis is nutsen.

1355
01:57:15,487 --> 01:57:17,488
Uh-oh. Big boomers.

1356
01:57:38,218 --> 01:57:40,637
Give me a lift!

1357
01:57:47,853 --> 01:57:49,520
Jar Jar, usen da booma!

1358
01:57:49,605 --> 01:57:51,564
What? Mesa no have a booma!

1359
01:57:51,649 --> 01:57:53,650
Here. Taken dis one.

1360
01:58:10,042 --> 01:58:11,125
Jar Jar!

1361
01:58:11,210 --> 01:58:13,294
Jump, Jar Jar, jump!

1362
01:58:23,389 --> 01:58:26,182
Put down your weapons. They win this round.

1363
01:58:39,071 --> 01:58:41,322
We're hit, R2!

1364
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:57,505
I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop!

1365
01:59:04,638 --> 01:59:06,222
Everything's overheated.

1366
01:59:07,641 --> 01:59:09,684
Oops. This is not good.

1367
02:00:22,049 --> 02:00:24,300
No giben up, General Jar Jar.

1368
02:00:24,384 --> 02:00:26,260
Mesa think of something.

1369
02:00:26,345 --> 02:00:27,804
Hands up.

1370
02:00:27,888 --> 02:00:30,807
My give up. My give up.

1371
02:00:39,483 --> 02:00:42,610
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.

1372
02:00:42,694 --> 02:00:44,654
Time for you to sign the treaty...

1373
02:00:44,738 --> 02:00:46,656
and end this pointless
debate in the senate.

1374
02:00:46,740 --> 02:00:48,533
Viceroy!

1375
02:00:48,617 --> 02:00:50,618
Your occupation here has ended.

1376
02:00:52,121 --> 02:00:55,498
After her. This one's a decoy.

1377
02:01:02,047 --> 02:01:03,589
Captain!

1378
02:01:12,850 --> 02:01:14,851
Jam the doors.

1379
02:01:18,355 --> 02:01:21,190
Now, Viceroy, we will discuss a new treaty.

1380
02:02:24,421 --> 02:02:26,923
Yes! We have power. Shields up.

1381
02:02:30,135 --> 02:02:31,260
Take this!

1382
02:02:33,222 --> 02:02:34,305
And this!

1383
02:02:42,189 --> 02:02:44,023
- Oops.
- We're losing power.

1384
02:02:44,107 --> 02:02:45,942
There seems to be a problem
with the main reactor.

1385
02:02:46,026 --> 02:02:47,443
Impossible!

1386
02:02:47,527 --> 02:02:49,445
Nothing can get through our shield.

1387
02:02:50,697 --> 02:02:52,573
Let's get outta here.

1388
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:03,251
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1389
02:03:06,213 --> 02:03:07,797
We didn't hit it.

1390
02:03:10,884 --> 02:03:12,969
Now, this is Podracing.

1391
02:03:14,513 --> 02:03:16,305
Look, one of ours, out of the main hold!

1392
02:03:37,661 --> 02:03:39,120
What the...

1393
02:03:39,204 --> 02:03:41,497
Was'n they doing?

1394
02:03:41,581 --> 02:03:45,167
The control ship has been destroyed. Look!

1395
02:03:46,878 --> 02:03:49,297
They all broke-ed.

1396
02:04:37,637 --> 02:04:41,057
No, it's too late.

1397
02:04:41,141 --> 02:04:43,476
- No.
- Obi-Wan.

1398
02:04:44,728 --> 02:04:46,645
Promise...

1399
02:04:46,730 --> 02:04:49,315
Promise me you will train the boy.

1400
02:04:49,399 --> 02:04:51,025
Yes, Master.

1401
02:04:55,072 --> 02:04:57,656
He is the chosen one.

1402
02:04:57,741 --> 02:05:00,993
He will bring balance.

1403
02:05:02,162 --> 02:05:03,621
Train him.

1404
02:05:31,108 --> 02:05:32,942
Now, Viceroy...

1405
02:05:33,026 --> 02:05:36,487
you're going to have to go back
to the senate and explain all this.

1406
02:05:38,198 --> 02:05:41,492
I think you can kiss
your trade franchise good-bye.

1407
02:05:55,215 --> 02:05:58,801
We are indebted to you
for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1408
02:05:58,885 --> 02:06:00,803
And you, young Skywalker.

1409
02:06:01,555 --> 02:06:04,932
We will watch your career
with great interest.

1410
02:06:11,356 --> 02:06:13,983
Congratulations on your
election, Chancellor.

1411
02:06:14,067 --> 02:06:19,321
Your boldness has saved our people, Your Majesty.
It's you who should be congratulated.

1412
02:06:19,406 --> 02:06:24,076
Together we shall bring peace
and prosperity to the Republic.

1413
02:06:29,082 --> 02:06:33,544
Confer on you the level
of Jedi knight the council does.

1414
02:06:33,628 --> 02:06:38,382
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

1415
02:06:38,467 --> 02:06:40,426
I do not.

1416
02:06:40,510 --> 02:06:42,553
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1417
02:06:45,515 --> 02:06:48,184
The chosen one the boy may be.

1418
02:06:48,268 --> 02:06:49,935
Nevertheless...

1419
02:06:50,020 --> 02:06:52,938
grave danger I fear in his training.

1420
02:06:53,023 --> 02:06:57,193
Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1421
02:06:57,277 --> 02:06:59,236
I will train Anakin.

1422
02:07:01,448 --> 02:07:03,824
Without the approval
of the council, if I must.

1423
02:07:03,909 --> 02:07:06,452
Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you.

1424
02:07:06,536 --> 02:07:08,454
Need that you do not.

1425
02:07:10,707 --> 02:07:14,001
Agree with you the council does.

1426
02:07:15,045 --> 02:07:18,380
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1427
02:07:46,159 --> 02:07:47,952
What will happen to me now?

1428
02:07:48,036 --> 02:07:51,163
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1429
02:07:51,248 --> 02:07:54,625
You will be a Jedi, I promise.

1430
02:08:04,094 --> 02:08:07,513
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1431
02:08:07,597 --> 02:08:10,057
Always two there are.

1432
02:08:10,141 --> 02:08:13,394
No more, no less.

1433
02:08:13,478 --> 02:08:16,438
A master and an apprentice.

1434
02:08:16,523 --> 02:08:18,107
But which was destroyed?

1435
02:08:18,191 --> 02:08:21,151
The master or the apprentice?

1436
02:08:45,802 --> 02:08:47,928
Hidoe, everybody!

1437
02:09:34,517 --> 02:09:36,477
Peace!

1438

1
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,502
Did you hear that?

2
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:52,380
They shut down the main reactor.
We'll be destroyed for sure.

3
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:54,049
This is madness.

4
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,518
We're doomed.

5
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:10,148
There'll be no escape
for the princess this time.

6
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:14,944
What's that?

7
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,757
R2-D2, where are you?

8
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,776
At last. Where have you been?

9
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:21,988
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?

10
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,366
We'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines
or smashed into who knows what.

11
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,578
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

12
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:44,385
The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.

13
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:47,096
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?

14
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:50,016
What have you done with those plans?

15
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,101
We intercepted no transmissions.

16
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:57,065
This is a consular ship.
We're on a diplomatic mission.

17
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:01,778
If this is a consular ship,
where is the ambassador?

18
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,743
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans!

19
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,788
And bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

20
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,802
There's one. Set for stun.

21
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,184
She'll be all right.

22
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:35,186
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

23
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:39,274
Hey. You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.

24
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,317
You'll be deactivated for sure.

25
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,905
Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease.

26
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,657
Come out, before somebody sees you.

27
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,245
Secret mission? What plans?

28
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,956
What are you talking about?
I'm not getting in there.

29
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:00,545
I'm going to regret this.

30
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:11,014
- There goes another one.
- Hold your fire. There's no life-forms.

31
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,432
It must have short-circuited.

32
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:15,852
That's funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.

33
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,189
Are you sure this thing is safe?

34
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,627
Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold.

35
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:45,340
The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this.
When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...

36
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:47,508
Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.

37
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,510
You weren't on
any mercy mission this time.

38
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:53,723
Several transmissions
were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.

39
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,684
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

40
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,811
I don't know what you're talking about.

41
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:01,898
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

42
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,859
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.

43
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,903
Take her away!

44
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,742
Holding her is dangerous.

45
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,371
If word of this gets out, it could generate
sympathy for the rebellion in the senate.

46
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,831
I have traced the rebel spies to her.

47
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,626
Now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.

48
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,628
She'll die before
she'll tell you anything.

49
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,380
Leave that to me.

50
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:28,966
Send a distress signal, and then inform
the senate that all aboard were killed.

51
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:32,178
Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship...

52
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,721
and no transmissions were made.

53
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:38,017
An escape pod was jettisoned during the
fighting, but no life-forms were aboard.

54
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:41,104
She must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.

55
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,774
Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
See to it personally, Commander.

56
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,943
There'll be no one to stop us this time.

57
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,611
Yes, sir.

58
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:05,211
How did we get into this mess?

59
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,672
I really don't know how.

60
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,634
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

61
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,849
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.

62
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,941
What a desolate place this is.

63
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,114
Where do you think you're going?

64
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,699
Well, I'm not going that way.

65
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,993
It's much too rocky.

66
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,495
This way is much easier.

67
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,998
What makes you think
there are settlements over there?

68
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,501
Don't get technical with me.

69
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,838
What mission? What are you talking about?

70
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:53,259
I've just about had enough of you.

71
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,303
Go that way.

72
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,222
You'll be malfunctioning within a day,
you nearsighted scrap pile.

73
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,975
And don't let me catch you
following me, begging for help...

74
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,560
because you won't get it.

75
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,743
No more adventures.

76
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,828
I'm not going that way.

77
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,740
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.

78
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,952
He tricked me into going this way...

79
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,954
but he'll do no better.

80
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,334
Wait. What's that?

81
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,170
A transport. I'm saved.

82
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:13,005
Over here!

83
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,716
Hey! Hey!

84
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:19,262
Help! Please help!

85
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:50,765
R2?

86
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:58,564
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

87
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,351
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.

88
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,312
Look, sir. Droids.

89
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,286
We stopped.

90
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,163
Wake up. Wake up!

91
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,713
We're doomed.

92
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,014
Do you think they'll melt us down?

93
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,989
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

94
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,574
Will this never end?

95
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:14,408
- Fine. Let's go.
- Luke!

96
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,993
Luke!

97
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:24,501
Luke, tell your uncle if he gets a
translator, be sure it speaks Bocce.

98
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:27,129
Doesn't look like we have much choice,
but I'll remind him.

99
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,434
Yeah, we'll take that red one.

100
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,478
No, not that one.

101
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:47,232
You. I suppose you're programmed
for etiquette and protocol.

102
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:51,320
Protocol? It's my primary function, sir.
I am well-versed in all the customs...

103
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,740
- I have no need for a protocol droid.
- Of course you haven't, sir.

104
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,576
Not in an environment such as this.
That's why I have been programmed...

105
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:01,705
I need a droid who understands
the binary language of moisture vaporators.

106
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,084
Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters...

107
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,336
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

108
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,965
- Can you speak Bocce?
- Of course. It's like a second language.

109
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,258
- All right. Shut up. I'll take this one.
- Shutting up, sir.

110
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:14,551
Luke!

111
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,682
Take these two to the garage.
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

112
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,685
But I was going into Tosche Station
to pick up some power converters.

113
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,020
You can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done.

114
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,689
Now come on. Get to it.

115
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:29,984
All right. Come on.

116
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,363
And the red one. Come on.

117
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,574
Come on, red. Let's go.

118
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,388
- Uncle Owen.
- Yeah?

119
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,224
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.

120
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,727
Hey, what are you trying to push on us?

121
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:12,693
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit
is in prime condition, a real bargain.

122
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,695
Uncle Owen, what about that one?

123
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,322
What about that blue one?
We'll take that one.

124
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,867
Take this away.

125
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,535
You'll be pleased with that one, sir.

126
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,538
He really is in first-class condition.
I've worked with him before.

127
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:25,622
Here he comes.

128
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,253
Okay. Let's go.

129
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,088
Don't you forget this.

130
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:36,675
Why I should stick my neck out for you
is quite beyond my capacity.

131
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,101
Thank the maker.
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

132
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:51,190
I've got such a bad case of dust
contamination, I can barely move.

133
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:52,900
It just isn't fair.

134
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,736
Biggs is right.
I'm never gonna get out of here.

135
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,363
Is there anything I might do to help?

136
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:01,658
No, not unless you can alter time,
speed up the harvest...

137
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,410
or teleport me off this rock.

138
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:05,079
I don't think so, sir.

139
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:08,207
I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable
about such things.

140
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,209
Not on this planet, anyway.

141
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:13,712
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

142
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,923
Well, if there's a bright center
to the universe...

143
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:18,258
you're on the planet
that it's farthest from.

144
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,302
I see, sir.

145
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,388
- You can call me Luke.
- I see, Sir Luke.

146
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:26,266
Just Luke.

147
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:30,104
And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

148
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,856
And this is my counterpart, R2-D2.

149
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:33,982
Hello.

150
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:39,113
You got a lot of carbon scoring here.
Looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.

151
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:40,405
With all we've been through...

152
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,741
sometimes I'm amazed
we're in as good condition as we are...

153
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,493
what with the rebellion and all.

154
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,537
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire?

155
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:49,456
That's how we came to be in your service,
if you take my meaning, sir.

156
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,459
- Have you been in many battles?
- Several, I think.

157
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,461
There's not much to tell.

158
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:58,132
I'm not much more than an interpreter
and not very good at telling stories.

159
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,759
Well, not at making them
interesting, anyway.

160
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,387
Well, my little friend...

161
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,556
you got something jammed
in here real good.

162
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,141
Were you on a Starcruiser or...

163
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:11,061
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

164
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:12,771
What's this?

165
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:15,983
"What is what"?
He asked you a question. What is that?

166
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:20,028
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

167
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:27,369
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

168
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,874
He says it's nothing, sir,
merely a malfunction.

169
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,293
Old data. Pay it no mind.

170
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,461
Who is she? She's beautiful.

171
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:39,923
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

172
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:42,176
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

173
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,261
A person of some importance, I believe.

174
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,763
- Our captain was...
- Is there any more to this recording?

175
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:52,102
Behave yourself, R2.
You're going to get us into trouble.

176
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:54,980
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.

177
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,732
You're my only hope.

178
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:02,738
He says he's the property of Obi-Wan
Kenobi, a resident of these parts...

179
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,615
and it's a private message for him.

180
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,742
Frankly, I don't know
what he's talking about.

181
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,827
Our last master was Captain Antilles.

182
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:13,582
But with all we've been through,
this R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.

183
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,835
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

184
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,588
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know
what he's talking about?

185
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,132
I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan...

186
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,093
but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.

187
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,970
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

188
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,098
I wonder who she is.

189
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:33,101
Sounds like she's in trouble.
I better play back the whole thing.

190
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:40,150
He says the restraining bolt has
short-circuited his recording system.

191
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:43,070
He suggests that if you remove the bolt...

192
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:45,906
he might be able to play back
the entire recording.

193
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,116
Oh, yeah. Well...

194
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:51,703
I guess you're too small
to run away on me if I take this off.

195
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:52,996
Okay.

196
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,501
There you go.

197
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:02,381
Where'd she go? Bring her back.
Play back the entire message.

198
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:03,465
"What message"?

199
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:05,884
The one you've just been playing.

200
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,136
The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.

201
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:10,555
Luke! Luke!

202
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,891
I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.

203
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:16,103
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

204
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:19,648
Here. See what you can do with him.
I'll be right back.

205
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:25,153
Just you reconsider
playing that message for him.

206
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,115
No, I don't think he likes you at all.

207
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,159
No, I don't like you either.

208
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:43,714
- I think that R2 unit might have been stolen.
- What makes you think that?

209
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:46,758
I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

210
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:49,344
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

211
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,225
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what he's talking about?

212
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:59,521
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

213
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,398
That wizard's just a crazy old man.

214
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:06,403
Tomorrow, take that R2 unit to Anchorhead
and have its memory erased.

215
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,572
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

216
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:12,951
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

217
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,161
He won't.

218
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:19,124
I don't think he exists anymore.
He died about the same time as your father.

219
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,336
- He knew my father?
- I told you to forget it.

220
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:26,465
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

221
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:30,510
In the morning, I want them on the south
ridge, working on those condensers.

222
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,679
Yes, sir.

223
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,516
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

224
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:39,978
In fact, I was also thinking
about our agreement...

225
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:41,855
about me staying on another season.

226
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,569
If these new droids work out,
I want to apply to the academy this year.

227
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,405
You mean the next semester
before the harvest?

228
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,324
Sure. There's more than enough droids.

229
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,451
Harvest is when I need you the most.

230
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,578
It's only one season more.

231
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:59,831
This year we'll make enough
on the harvest to hire more hands...

232
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:02,209
and then you can go
to the academy next year.

233
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,170
You must understand I need you here, Luke.

234
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:08,173
- But it's a whole 'nother year.
- It's only one more season.

235
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,342
That's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

236
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,928
- Where are you going?
- Looks like I'm going nowhere.

237
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,805
I have to go finish cleaning those droids.

238
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:18,266
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.

239
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:20,394
It means so much to him.

240
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:23,480
I'll make it up to him next year.
I promise.

241
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:29,111
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.

242
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:31,405
That's what I'm afraid of.

243
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,748
- What are you doing hiding back there?
- It wasn't my fault, sir.

244
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,625
Please don't deactivate me.

245
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,378
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

246
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:31,673
- Kept babbling on about his mission.
- Oh, no.

247
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:42,559
That R2 unit has always been a problem.

248
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:45,270
These astro droids
are getting quite out of hand.

249
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,606
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.

250
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,400
How could I be so stupid?
He's nowhere in sight.

251
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:51,443
Blast it!

252
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,154
Pardon me, sir, but
couldn't we go after him?

253
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:57,449
It's too dangerous with the Sandpeople around.
We'll have to wait till morning.

254
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,534
Luke, I'm shutting the power down.

255
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,578
I'll be there in a few minutes.

256
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,747
Boy, am I gonna get it.

257
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:06,833
That little droid's gonna cause me
a lot of trouble.

258
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:08,877
He excels at that, sir.

259
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:11,505
Come on.

260
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,485
Have you seen Luke this morning?

261
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,988
He said he had things to do before
he started today, so he left early.

262
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:40,158
- Did he take those new droids with him?
- I think so.

263
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,662
He better have those units in
the south range repaired by midday...

264
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,413
or there'll be hell to pay.

265
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,000
There's a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.

266
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:52,087
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator.

267
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,570
Where do you think you're going?

268
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:19,406
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.

269
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,492
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

270
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:25,328
Don't talk to me of your mission either.

271
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:28,540
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you
into a million pieces right here.

272
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,667
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.

273
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,295
What's wrong with him now?

274
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,464
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

275
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:39,134
Sandpeople. Or worse.

276
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,721
Come on. Let's go have a look.

277
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:43,805
Come on.

278
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:50,270
Well, there are two Banthas down there,
but I don't see any...

279
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,147
Wait a second.

280
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:55,108
They're Sandpeople, all right.
I can see one of them now.

281
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:10,934
Hello there.

282
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:16,606
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.

283
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,069
Don't worry. He'll be all right.

284
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:29,786
Rest easy, son. You've had a busy day.

285
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:33,581
You're fortunate to be all in one piece.

286
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:39,045
Ben? Ben Kenobi?

287
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,131
Boy, am I glad to see you.

288
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:44,259
The Jundland Wastes
are not to be traveled lightly.

289
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:50,974
Tell me, young Luke,
what brings you out this far?

290
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:53,309
This little droid.

291
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,938
I think he's searching
for his former master...

292
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,149
but I've never seen
such devotion in a droid before.

293
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:04,320
He claims to be the property
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

294
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:07,031
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he's talking about?

295
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:10,243
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

296
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,122
Obi-Wan.

297
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,043
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.

298
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,629
A long time.

299
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,717
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.

300
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:27,510
He's not dead.

301
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:28,803
Not yet.

302
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:31,890
- You know him?
- Of course I know him.

303
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:33,349
He's me.

304
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:39,314
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan...

305
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,066
since, oh, before you were born.

306
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:43,777
Then the droid does belong to you.

307
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:46,529
I don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

308
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,866
Very interesting.

309
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:53,828
I think we better get indoors.

310
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:57,207
The Sandpeople are easily startled...

311
00:31:57,291 --> 00:32:00,126
but they'll soon be back...
and in greater numbers.

312
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,339
3PO.

313
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,392
Where am I? I must have taken a bad step.

314
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:21,105
Can you stand? We've gotta get out
of here before the Sandpeople return.

315
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,942
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

316
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:28,071
There's no sense in you risking yourself
on my account. I'm done for.

317
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,032
No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?

318
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,034
Quickly. They're on the move.

319
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:41,709
My father didn't fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.

320
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:45,547
That's what your uncle told you.
He didn't hold with your father's ideals.

321
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:48,758
Thought he should have stayed here
and not gotten involved.

322
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,803
- You fought in the Clone Wars?
- Yes.

323
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:55,557
I was once a Jedi knight,
the same as your father.

324
00:32:58,102 --> 00:32:59,853
I wish I'd known him.

325
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:02,689
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy...

326
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:05,483
and a cunning warrior.

327
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:08,111
I understand you've become
quite a good pilot yourself.

328
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,115
And he was a good friend.

329
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:14,284
Which reminds me...

330
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,495
I have something here for you.

331
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:22,125
Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough...

332
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,919
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.

333
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,881
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan...

334
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:31,426
on some damn-fool idealistic crusade,
like your father did.

335
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,470
Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for a while.

336
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:36,139
Sure. Go ahead.

337
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:42,228
- What is it?
- Your father's lightsaber.

338
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,606
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

339
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:48,526
Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.

340
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,779
An elegant weapon...

341
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:54,866
for a more civilized age.

342
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:59,120
For over a thousand generations,
the Jedi knights...

343
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:03,166
were the guardians of
peace and justice in the old Republic...

344
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,002
before the dark times...

345
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,795
before the Empire.

346
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,759
How did my father die?

347
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,764
A young Jedi named Darth Vader...

348
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:20,433
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil...

349
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:24,520
helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.

350
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:28,775
He betrayed and murdered your father.

351
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,820
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

352
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:37,784
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

353
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:39,452
The Force?

354
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,206
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.

355
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:46,417
It's an energy field
created by all living things.

356
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:49,087
It surrounds us and penetrates us.

357
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:51,214
It binds the galaxy together.

358
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,848
Let's see if we can't figure out
what you are, my little friend...

359
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,185
and where you come from.

360
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:07,438
- I saw part of a message...
- I seem to have found it.

361
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:11,859
General Kenobi, years ago you served
my father in the Clone Wars.

362
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:15,405
Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.

363
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:18,616
I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request in person.

364
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:20,576
But my ship has fallen under attack...

365
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:22,954
and I'm afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.

366
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:26,332
I have placed information
vital to the survival of the rebellion...

367
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:28,501
into the memory systems of this R2 unit.

368
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,420
My father will know how to retrieve it.

369
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:34,382
You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.

370
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,718
This is our most desperate hour.

371
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,847
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

372
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:59,866
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

373
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,409
Alderaan?

374
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,369
I'm not going to Alderaan.

375
00:36:03,454 --> 00:36:05,830
I've gotta get home.
It's late. I'm in for it as it is.

376
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:08,332
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.

377
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:11,586
I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.

378
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:19,552
I can't get involved. I've got work to do.

379
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,180
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it.

380
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:24,849
But there's nothing
I can do about it right now.

381
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:29,854
- It's all such a long way from here.
- That's your uncle talking.

382
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:33,816
Oh, boy. My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?

383
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:35,610
Learn about the Force, Luke.

384
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:44,994
I can take you as far as Anchorhead.

385
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:49,082
You can get a transport there
to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

386
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:53,294
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

387
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:04,472
Until this battle station is fully
operational, we are vulnerable.

388
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,724
The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.

389
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:08,726
They're more dangerous than you realize.

390
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:11,729
Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander...

391
00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:13,523
not to this battle station.

392
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:17,235
The rebellion will continue to
gain support in the Imperial Senate...

393
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:21,030
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

394
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:25,910
I've just received word that the emperor
has dissolved the council permanently.

395
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:29,664
The last remnants of the old Republic
have been swept away.

396
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:31,749
That's impossible.

397
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:34,127
How will the emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

398
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:38,756
The regional governors now have
direct control over their territories.

399
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:43,136
Fear will keep the local systems in line.

400
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,346
Fear of this battle station.

401
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,597
And what of the rebellion?

402
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:49,934
If the rebels have obtained a complete
technical readout of this station...

403
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,978
it is possible, however unlikely...

404
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:54,188
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.

405
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:58,526
The plans you refer to
will soon be back in our hands.

406
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,905
Any attack by the rebels against this
station would be a useless gesture...

407
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,991
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

408
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:08,703
This station is now
the ultimate power in the universe.

409
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,122
I suggest we use it.

410
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:15,459
Don't be too proud of this
technological terror you've constructed.

411
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:18,963
The ability to destroy a planet
is insignificant...

412
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,882
next to the power of the Force.

413
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:24,427
Don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.

414
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,180
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion...

415
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:30,057
has not helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes...

416
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:34,228
or given you clairvoyance enough
to find the rebels' hidden fortress...

417
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:44,071
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

418
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,909
Enough of this. Vader, release him.

419
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,452
As you wish.

420
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,748
This bickering is pointless.

421
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:58,628
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress...

422
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:00,796
by the time this station is operational.

423
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:04,634
We will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke.

424
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:16,187
It looks like the Sandpeople did this.
There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.

425
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,606
I've just never heard of them
hitting anything this big before.

426
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,026
They didn't, but we are
meant to think they did.

427
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,028
These tracks are side-by-side.

428
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:28,282
Sandpeople always ride single file
to hide their numbers.

429
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:31,244
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.

430
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:35,539
And these blast points,
too accurate for Sandpeople.

431
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:40,127
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

432
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:42,755
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

433
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:51,180
If they traced the robots here, they may
have learned who they sold them to...

434
00:39:51,265 --> 00:39:53,266
and that would lead them back... home.

435
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,642
Wait, Luke.

436
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,727
It's too dangerous.

437
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:22,712
Uncle Owen.

438
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:23,796
Aunt Beru.

439
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:26,048
Uncle Owen.

440
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:21,937
Now, Your Highness, we will discuss
the location of your hidden rebel base.

441
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,274
There's nothing you could have done,
had you been there.

442
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,027
You'd have been killed too...

443
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:12,822
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

444
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:16,617
I want to come with you to Alderaan.

445
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:19,370
There's nothing for me here now.

446
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:22,456
I want to learn the ways of the Force
and become a Jedi like my father.

447
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:40,516
Mos Eisley spaceport.

448
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,396
You will never find a more wretched hive
of scum and villainy.

449
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,857
We must be cautious.

450
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:31,108
How long have you had these droids?

451
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:34,361
- Three or four seasons.
- They're up for sale if you want them.

452
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:36,363
Let me see your identification.

453
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,742
You don't need to see his identification.

454
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,203
We don't need to see his identification.

455
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,830
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

456
00:43:44,915 --> 00:43:46,874
These aren't the droids we're looking for.

457
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,419
He can go about his business.

458
00:43:50,504 --> 00:43:53,756
- You can go about your business.
- Move along.

459
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,425
Move along. Move along.

460
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:15,903
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures.

461
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:18,405
Go on, go on.

462
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,452
I can't understand how we got by those troops.
I thought we were dead.

463
00:44:23,537 --> 00:44:27,873
The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded.

464
00:44:31,253 --> 00:44:34,213
You really think we're gonna find
a pilot here to take us to Alderaan?

465
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:37,258
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here.

466
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:41,178
Only watch your step...
this place can be a little rough.

467
00:44:41,263 --> 00:44:43,013
I'm ready for anything.

468
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:48,269
Come along, R2.

469
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,323
- Hey. We don't serve their kind here.
- What?

470
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:45,367
Your droids... they'll have to wait outside.
We don't want them here.

471
00:45:45,452 --> 00:45:47,911
Wait out by the speeder.
We don't want any trouble.

472
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:49,997
I heartily agree with you, sir.

473
00:45:59,633 --> 00:46:01,133
I'll have one of those.

474
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:39,046
- He doesn't like you.
- I'm sorry.

475
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:44,593
I don't like you either.
You just watch yourself.

476
00:46:44,678 --> 00:46:49,264
We're wanted men.
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.

477
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:52,184
- I'll be careful then.
- You'll be dead!

478
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,228
This little one's not worth the effort.

479
00:46:55,397 --> 00:46:56,563
Come, let me get you something.

480
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:25,718
I'm all right.

481
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:31,598
Chewbacca here is first mate
on a ship that might suit us.

482
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:38,564
I don't like the look of this.

483
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:56,957
Han Solo. I'm captain
of the Millennium Falcon.

484
00:47:57,041 --> 00:48:00,252
Chewie here tells me you're looking
for passage to the Alderaan system.

485
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:02,671
Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.

486
00:48:02,756 --> 00:48:06,550
Fast ship? You've never heard of
the Millennium Falcon?

487
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:08,260
Should I have?

488
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:11,513
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.

489
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:15,809
I've outrun imperial starships.

490
00:48:15,894 --> 00:48:17,895
Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.

491
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:20,147
I'm talking about
the big Corellian ships now.

492
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,984
She's fast enough for you, old man.

493
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:27,946
- What's the cargo?
- Only passengers...

494
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:30,866
myself, the boy, two droids...

495
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:33,952
and no questions asked.

496
00:48:35,163 --> 00:48:37,039
Is it some kind of local trouble?

497
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:42,336
Let's just say we'd like to avoid
any imperial entanglements.

498
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:46,507
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

499
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,550
And it's gonna cost you something extra.

500
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:52,137
10,000, all in advance.

501
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:55,182
10,000?

502
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:59,019
We could almost buy our own ship for that.

503
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,355
But who's gonna fly it, kid? You?

504
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,524
You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot.

505
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:06,026
We don't have to sit here and listen...

506
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,987
We can pay you 2,000 now...

507
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:12,366
plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.

508
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:14,326
Seventeen?

509
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:20,290
Okay, you guys got yourselves a ship.

510
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,876
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Docking Bay 94.

511
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:24,169
Ninety-four.

512
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:29,216
Looks like somebody's beginning
to take an interest in your handiwork.

513
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,886
All right. We'll check it out.

514
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:48,193
17,000. Those guys
must really be desperate.

515
00:49:48,278 --> 00:49:51,738
This could really save my neck.
Get back to the ship, get it ready.

516
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:54,867
- You'll have to sell your speeder.
- That's okay.

517
00:49:54,951 --> 00:49:56,994
I'm never coming back
to this planet again.

518
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,581
Going somewhere, Solo?

519
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:03,667
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

520
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:06,003
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

521
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:08,005
It's too late.

522
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:10,507
You should have paid him
when you had the chance.

523
00:50:10,592 --> 00:50:12,718
Jabba's put a price on
your head so large...

524
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:15,512
every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you...

525
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,182
I'm lucky I found you first.

526
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:21,476
Yeah, but this time I've got the money.

527
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:25,147
If you give it to me, I
might forget I found you.

528
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:28,567
I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...

529
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:30,152
Jabba's through with you.

530
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,780
He has no time for smugglers...

531
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:36,533
who drop their shipments
at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.

532
00:50:36,618 --> 00:50:40,370
Even I get boarded sometimes.
Do you think I had a choice?

533
00:50:40,455 --> 00:50:44,583
You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.

534
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:46,877
Over my dead body.

535
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:48,128
That's the idea.

536
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:52,215
I've been looking forward
to this for a long time.

537
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,634
I'll bet you have.

538
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,316
Sorry about the mess.

539
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:21,745
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

540
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:25,248
It'll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.

541
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:28,919
The final checkout is completed.
All systems are operational.

542
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:31,254
What course shall we set?

543
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:34,758
Perhaps she would respond
to an alternative form of persuasion.

544
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,468
What do you mean?

545
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:39,513
I think it is time we demonstrated
the full power of this station.

546
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:42,099
- Set your course for Alderaan.
- With pleasure.

547
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,310
Lock the door, R2.

548
00:51:47,397 --> 00:51:49,398
Check this side of the street.

549
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:56,196
The door's locked.
Move on to the next one.

550
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:05,747
I would much rather have gone with
Master Luke than stay here with you.

551
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:09,960
I don't know what this trouble is about,
but I'm sure it must be your fault.

552
00:52:10,712 --> 00:52:12,295
You watch your language.

553
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,883
All right. Give it to me. I'll take it.

554
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:21,304
Look at this. Ever since the XP-38
came out, they just aren't in demand.

555
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:23,390
It'll be enough.

556
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:45,328
Solo! Come out of there, Solo!

557
00:52:46,164 --> 00:52:48,165
Right here, Jabba.

558
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,917
I've been waitin' for you.

559
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:53,378
Have you now.

560
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:56,214
You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?

561
00:52:57,633 --> 00:53:02,095
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.

562
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,264
Why haven't you paid me...

563
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:07,768
and why did you fry poor Greedo?

564
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:10,604
Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me,
come see me yourself.

565
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:12,189
Don't send one of these twerps.

566
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:15,776
Han, I can't make exceptions.

567
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,737
What if everyone who smuggled for me...

568
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,406
dropped their cargo at the first sign...

569
00:53:21,491 --> 00:53:24,159
of an imperial starship?

570
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:26,161
It's not good business.

571
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:29,664
Look, Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.

572
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:33,376
You think I had a choice?

573
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:35,253
But I got a nice, easy charter.

574
00:53:35,338 --> 00:53:39,382
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.
I just need a little more time.

575
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:44,638
Han, my boy, you're the best.

576
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:47,557
So, for an extra twenty percent...

577
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:49,643
Fifteen, Jabba. Don't push it.

578
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:51,812
Okay, fifteen percent.

579
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:54,064
But if you fail me again...

580
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:57,067
I'll put a price on your head so big...

581
00:53:57,151 --> 00:54:01,404
you won't be able to go
near a civilized system.

582
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:04,282
Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.

583
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:06,910
Come on!

584
00:54:12,834 --> 00:54:16,545
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting,
we ought to do well.

585
00:54:40,236 --> 00:54:42,154
What a piece of junk.

586
00:54:42,238 --> 00:54:44,781
She'll make .5 past light speed.

587
00:54:44,866 --> 00:54:47,659
She may not look like much,
but she's got it where it counts, kid.

588
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:50,745
I've made a lot of special
modifications myself.

589
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:54,749
But we're a little rushed, so if you'll
just get on board, we'll get outta here.

590
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:00,839
Hello, sir.

591
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:11,016
Which way?

592
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:15,020
All right, men, load your weapons.

593
00:55:16,606 --> 00:55:19,232
Stop that ship. Blast them.

594
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:31,036
Chewie, get us out of here!

595
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:36,041
Oh, my. I'd forgotten
how much I hate space travel.

596
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:58,021
Looks like an imperial cruiser.
Our passengers are hotter than I thought.

597
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,522
Hold 'em off.
Angle the deflector shields...

598
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:01,733
while I make the calculations
for the jump to light speed.

599
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:15,372
Stay sharp. There's two more comin' in.
They're gonna try and cut us off.

600
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:17,540
Why don't you outrun 'em?
You said this thing was fast.

601
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:19,501
Watch your mouth or you're gonna
find yourself floating home.

602
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:23,004
We'll be safe enough
once we make the jump to hyperspace.

603
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:24,965
Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
We'll lose 'em.

604
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:31,096
Here's where the fun begins.

605
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,973
How long before you can
jump to light speed?

606
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:35,976
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.

607
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,644
Are you kidding?
At the rate they're gaining?

608
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:40,772
Traveling through hyperspace
ain't like dustin' crops, boy.

609
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:43,316
Without precise calculations,
we'd fly right through a star...

610
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:47,028
or bounce too close to a supernova,
and that would end your trip real quick.

611
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:49,489
- What's that flashing?
- We're losing a deflector shield.

612
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:52,534
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.

613
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:15,849
We've entered the Alderaan system.

614
00:57:16,851 --> 00:57:20,812
Governor Tarkin. I should have expected
to find you holding Vader's leash.

615
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:24,566
I recognized your foul stench
when I was brought on board.

616
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:28,111
Charming to the last.

617
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:30,697
You don't know how hard I found it...

618
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,699
signing the order to terminate your life.

619
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:35,660
I'm surprised you had the courage
to take the responsibility yourself.

620
00:57:35,745 --> 00:57:38,913
Princess Leia, before your execution...

621
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:41,207
I would like you to be my guest
at a ceremony...

622
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:44,294
that will make
this battle station operational.

623
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:47,213
No star system will dare
oppose the emperor now.

624
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:50,050
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin...

625
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:52,802
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

626
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:55,638
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

627
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:59,768
In a way, you have determined
the choice of the planet...

628
00:57:59,852 --> 00:58:01,978
that'll be destroyed first.

629
00:58:02,063 --> 00:58:06,608
Since you are reluctant to provide us
with the location of the rebel base...

630
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:09,486
I have chosen to test
this station's destructive power...

631
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:11,571
on your home planet of Alderaan.

632
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:15,325
No. Alderaan is peaceful.
We have no weapons.

633
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,744
You would prefer another target?
A military target?

634
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:20,080
Then name the system.

635
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:25,335
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

636
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:28,088
Where is the rebel base?

637
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:33,259
Dantooine.

638
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:35,720
They're on Dantooine.

639
00:58:35,805 --> 00:58:39,182
There. You see, Lord Vader?
She can be reasonable.

640
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:42,143
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.

641
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:44,396
- What?
- You're far too trusting.

642
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,940
Dantooine is too remote
to make an effective demonstration.

643
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:51,611
But don't worry. We will deal with
your rebel friends soon enough.

644
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:56,116
Commence primary ignition.

645
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,641
Are you all right? What's wrong?

646
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,228
I felt a great disturbance in the Force...

647
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:28,523
as if millions of voices suddenly
cried out in terror...

648
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,567
and were suddenly silenced.

649
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:33,319
I fear something terrible has happened.

650
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:37,282
You'd better get on with your exercises.

651
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:42,245
You can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.

652
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,330
I told you I'd outrun them.

653
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:50,378
Don't everybody thank me at once.

654
00:59:50,463 --> 00:59:53,882
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.

655
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:04,434
Now be careful, R2.

656
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:16,404
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.

657
01:00:16,489 --> 01:00:18,656
Let him have it.
It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.

658
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:21,117
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

659
01:00:21,202 --> 01:00:25,788
That's 'cause a droid don't pull people's
arms out of their sockets when they lose.

660
01:00:25,873 --> 01:00:28,082
Wookiees are known to do that.

661
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:31,628
I see your point, sir.

662
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:35,381
I suggest a new strategy, R2.
Let the Wookiee win.

663
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:57,487
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

664
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,573
- You mean it controls your actions?
- Partially.

665
01:01:00,658 --> 01:01:02,575
But it also obeys your commands.

666
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:12,043
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are
no match for a blaster at your side, kid.

667
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:14,420
You don't believe in the Force, do you?

668
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:17,674
Kid, I've flown from one side
of this galaxy to the other.

669
01:01:17,758 --> 01:01:19,676
I've seen a lot of strange stuff...

670
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,011
but I've never seen anything
to make me believe...

671
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:25,473
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything.

672
01:01:25,558 --> 01:01:29,686
There's no mystical energy field
controls my destiny.

673
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,647
It's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.

674
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:35,608
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

675
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:39,988
This time, let go your conscious self...

676
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:44,033
and act on instinct.

677
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,580
With the blast shield down, I can't see.
How am I supposed to fight?

678
01:01:48,664 --> 01:01:51,124
Your eyes can deceive you.
Don't trust them.

679
01:02:00,509 --> 01:02:02,844
Stretch out with your feelings.

680
01:02:17,276 --> 01:02:19,444
You see? You can do it.

681
01:02:19,528 --> 01:02:21,195
I call it luck.

682
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,906
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.

683
01:02:23,991 --> 01:02:26,242
Good against remotes is one thing.

684
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:29,329
Good against the living,
that's something else.

685
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:32,457
We're coming up on Alderaan.

686
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:38,504
I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.

687
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:43,009
That's good. You've taken
your first step into a larger world.

688
01:02:48,182 --> 01:02:49,766
Yes?

689
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:51,851
Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.

690
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:53,853
They found the remains of a rebel base...

691
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:56,314
but they estimate that
it has been deserted for some time.

692
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:59,776
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

693
01:03:00,778 --> 01:03:03,363
She lied. She lied to us.

694
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:07,158
I told you she would never
consciously betray the rebellion.

695
01:03:08,494 --> 01:03:10,286
Terminate her immediately.

696
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:16,334
Stand by, Chewie. Here we go.
Cut in the sublight engines.

697
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:20,171
What the...

698
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:25,468
We've come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower...

699
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:26,969
some kind of asteroid collision.

700
01:03:27,054 --> 01:03:29,389
- It's not on any of the charts.
- What's going on?

701
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:31,808
Our position's correct,
except no Alderaan.

702
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:34,143
- Where is it?
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

703
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:36,062
It ain't there. It's been blown away.

704
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:38,856
- What? How?
- Destroyed by the Empire.

705
01:03:38,941 --> 01:03:41,150
The entire starfleet
couldn't destroy the whole planet.

706
01:03:41,235 --> 01:03:43,820
It'd take a thousand ships
with more firepower than I've...

707
01:03:45,364 --> 01:03:47,615
- There's another ship coming in.
- Maybe they know what happened.

708
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,033
It's an imperial fighter.

709
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:53,663
- It followed us.
- No. It's a short-range fighter.

710
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:55,915
There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

711
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:01,921
Sure is leaving in a hurry.
If they identify us, we're in trouble.

712
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:04,132
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

713
01:04:04,216 --> 01:04:07,593
- Let it go. It's too far out of range.
- Not for long.

714
01:04:11,432 --> 01:04:14,684
A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.

715
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:17,437
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

716
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:20,440
He ain't gonna be around
long enough to tell anybody about us.

717
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:24,819
He's heading for that small moon.

718
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:27,447
I can get him before he gets there.
He's almost in range.

719
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:31,117
That's no moon.

720
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:34,579
- It's a space station.
- It's too big to be a space station.

721
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:40,334
I have a very bad feeling about this.

722
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:42,295
Turn the ship around.

723
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:44,630
Yeah. I think you're right. Full reverse.

724
01:04:44,715 --> 01:04:46,799
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

725
01:04:51,472 --> 01:04:53,639
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

726
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,602
Why are we still moving towards it?

727
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:59,520
We're caught in a tractor beam.
It's pulling us in.

728
01:04:59,605 --> 01:05:01,272
There's gotta be something you can do.

729
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:04,108
There's nothing I can do.
I'm at full power. I have to shut down.

730
01:05:04,193 --> 01:05:05,693
They're not gonna get me without a fight.

731
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,826
You can't win, but there are
alternatives to fighting.

732
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:32,595
Clear Bay 327.

733
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:35,056
We are opening the magnetic field.

734
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:51,572
To your stations. Come with me.

735
01:05:56,203 --> 01:05:59,622
Close all outboard shields.
Close all outboard shields.

736
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,291
Yes?

737
01:06:02,376 --> 01:06:05,378
We've captured a freighter entering
the remains of the Alderaan system.

738
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:09,298
Its markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.

739
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:13,219
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

740
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:16,389
She may yet be of some use to us.

741
01:06:21,395 --> 01:06:24,730
Unlock 1, 5, 7 and 9. Release charge.

742
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:33,990
There's no one on board, sir.

743
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:36,868
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after takeoff.

744
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:40,454
It must be a decoy.
Several escape pods have been jettisoned.

745
01:06:40,539 --> 01:06:42,498
- Did you find any droids?
- No, sir.

746
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:44,458
If there were any,
they must also have jettisoned.

747
01:06:44,543 --> 01:06:48,045
Send a scanning crew aboard.
I want every part of this ship checked.

748
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:49,380
Yes, sir.

749
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:51,048
I sense something...

750
01:06:51,133 --> 01:06:53,593
a presence I've not felt since...

751
01:06:56,305 --> 01:06:59,724
Get me a scanning crew in here.
I want every part of this ship checked.

752
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:10,693
There's no one here.

753
01:07:19,578 --> 01:07:21,704
Boy, it's lucky you have
these compartments.

754
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:24,916
I use them for smuggling. I never
thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em.

755
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,208
This is ridiculous.

756
01:07:26,293 --> 01:07:28,836
Even if I could take off,
I'd never get past the tractor beam.

757
01:07:28,921 --> 01:07:30,254
Leave that to me.

758
01:07:30,339 --> 01:07:33,382
Damn fool. I knew you were gonna say that.

759
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:36,969
Who's the more foolish,
the fool or the fool who follows him?

760
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:50,232
The ship's all yours. If the scanners
pick up anything, report it immediately.

761
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:53,319
All right. Let's go.

762
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:10,002
Hey, down there.

763
01:08:11,672 --> 01:08:13,673
Could you give us a hand with this?

764
01:08:22,057 --> 01:08:24,517
TK-421, why aren't you at your post?

765
01:08:25,686 --> 01:08:27,687
TK-421, do you copy?

766
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:42,660
Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.
I'll see what I can do.

767
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,888
Between his howling
and your blasting everything...

768
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:05,016
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

769
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:08,394
Bring 'em on. I prefer a straight fight
to sneakin' around.

770
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,271
We've found the computer outlet, sir.

771
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:13,399
Plug in. He should be able to
interpret the entire imperial network.

772
01:09:24,578 --> 01:09:28,080
He's found the controls to the power beam
that's holding the ship here.

773
01:09:28,165 --> 01:09:31,042
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

774
01:09:31,126 --> 01:09:35,379
The tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor in seven locations.

775
01:09:35,464 --> 01:09:38,507
A power loss at one of the terminals
will allow the ship to leave.

776
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:44,513
I don't think you boys can help.
I must go alone.

777
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:48,017
Whatever you say. I've done more than
I bargained for on this trip already.

778
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:51,979
- I want to go with you.
- Be patient, Luke. Watch the droids.

779
01:09:52,064 --> 01:09:54,023
They must be delivered safely...

780
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:57,318
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

781
01:09:57,402 --> 01:10:00,738
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.

782
01:10:04,284 --> 01:10:06,285
The Force will be with you...

783
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:07,787
always.

784
01:10:17,297 --> 01:10:19,590
You said it, Chewie.

785
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:22,093
Where did you dig up that old fossil?

786
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:24,720
Ben is a great man.

787
01:10:24,805 --> 01:10:27,765
- Great at getting us into trouble.
- I didn't hear you give any ideas.

788
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:30,893
Anything's better than just hangin'
around waiting for 'em to pick us up.

789
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:33,312
Who do you think...

790
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:36,649
- What is it?
- I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

791
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:39,318
He says, "I've found her,"
and keeps repeating, "She's here."

792
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:42,029
Who? Who has he found?

793
01:10:42,114 --> 01:10:44,865
- Princess Leia.
- The princess? She's here?

794
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:46,659
- Princess?
- Where is she?

795
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:48,661
Princess? What's going on?

796
01:10:54,084 --> 01:10:56,877
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

797
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:04,343
I'm afraid she's scheduled
to be terminated.

798
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:07,429
Oh, no. We've gotta do something.

799
01:11:07,514 --> 01:11:09,974
- What are you talking about?
- The droids belong to her.

800
01:11:10,058 --> 01:11:11,976
She's the one in the message.
We gotta help her.

801
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,937
Don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait here.

802
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:18,315
He didn't know she was here.
Find a way into that detention block.

803
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,860
- I'm not going anywhere.
- They're gonna execute her.

804
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:24,530
You said you didn't want to just wait
to be captured. Now you want to stay?

805
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:27,700
Marching into the detention area
is not what I had in mind.

806
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:30,619
- But they're gonna kill her.
- Better her than me.

807
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:39,712
She's rich.

808
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:43,716
Rich?

809
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:48,429
Rich, powerful. If you were to
rescue her, the reward would be...

810
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:51,307
- What?
- Well, more well than you can imagine.

811
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:53,392
I don't know. I can imagine quite a bit.

812
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:55,561
- You'll get it.
- I better.

813
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,146
You will.

814
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:59,690
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.

815
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:01,775
- All right.
- What's your plan?

816
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:05,279
3PO, hand me those binders there,
will you?

817
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:08,240
Okay.

818
01:12:08,909 --> 01:12:10,868
Now, I'm gonna put these on you.

819
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:15,206
Okay, Han, you put those on.

820
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,751
Don't worry, Chewie.
I think I know what he has in mind.

821
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:21,253
Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking...

822
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:24,590
but what should R2 and I do
if we're discovered here?

823
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:28,510
- Lock the door.
- And hope they don't have blasters.

824
01:12:28,595 --> 01:12:30,638
That isn't very reassuring.

825
01:12:50,951 --> 01:12:55,579
517 to scan control.
517 to scan control.

826
01:13:21,982 --> 01:13:24,316
I can't see a thing in this helmet.

827
01:13:55,724 --> 01:13:58,434
- This is not gonna work.
- Why didn't you say so before?

828
01:13:58,518 --> 01:14:00,519
I did say so before.

829
01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:18,704
Where are you taking this... thing?

830
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:21,540
Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.

831
01:14:22,876 --> 01:14:24,793
I wasn't notified.

832
01:14:24,878 --> 01:14:26,879
I'll have to clear it.

833
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:35,763
- Look out! He's loose!
- He'll tear us all apart!

834
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:00,871
Look out.

835
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:13,884
We gotta find out which cell
this princess of yours is in.

836
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:16,178
Here it is... 2187. You go and get her.

837
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:18,263
I'll hold them here.

838
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:24,812
Everything's under control.
Situation normal.

839
01:15:24,896 --> 01:15:26,105
What happened?

840
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:28,107
Had a slight weapons malfunction...

841
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:30,526
but everything's perfectly all right now.

842
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:33,862
We're fine. We're all fine here now.
Thank you.

843
01:15:33,947 --> 01:15:36,615
- How are you?
- We're sending a squad up.

844
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:40,786
Negative, negative.
We have a reactor leak here now.

845
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:44,790
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
Large leak, very dangerous.

846
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:47,459
Who is this? What's your operating number?

847
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:53,340
Boring conversation anyway.
Luke, we're gonna have company!

848
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:09,523
Aren't you a little short
for a stormtrooper?

849
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,401
Oh, the uniform.

850
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:15,904
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

851
01:16:15,989 --> 01:16:19,032
- You're who?
- I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit.

852
01:16:19,117 --> 01:16:21,076
- I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
- Ben Kenobi? Where is he?

853
01:16:21,161 --> 01:16:22,244
Come on.

854
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:27,458
- He is here.
- Obi-Wan Kenobi?

855
01:16:28,168 --> 01:16:31,545
- What makes you think so?
- A tremor in the Force.

856
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:35,466
The last time I felt it
was in the presence of my old master.

857
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:38,010
Surely he must be dead by now.

858
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:40,512
Don't underestimate the Force.

859
01:16:41,556 --> 01:16:44,850
The Jedi are extinct.
Their fire has gone out of the universe.

860
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:48,270
You, my friend, are all that's left
of their religion.

861
01:16:49,063 --> 01:16:50,272
Yes.

862
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:53,859
We have an emergency alert
in Detention Block AA-23.

863
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:57,070
The princess? Put all sections on alert.

864
01:16:57,155 --> 01:17:00,866
Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

865
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:03,785
If you're right,
he must not be allowed to escape.

866
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:07,372
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him alone.

867
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:18,217
Get behind me. Get behind me.

868
01:17:29,604 --> 01:17:32,397
Watch your left.
They went down the cell bay.

869
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:38,320
- Can't get out that way.
- You cut off our only escape route.

870
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:40,948
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.

871
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:45,661
- C-3PO. C-3PO.
- Yes, sir?

872
01:17:45,745 --> 01:17:49,248
Are there any other ways out of
the cell bay? We've been cut off.

873
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:53,669
What was that? I didn't copy.

874
01:17:53,753 --> 01:17:57,214
I said all systems have been
alerted to your presence, sir.

875
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:59,841
The main entrance
seems to be the only way in or out.

876
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:02,177
All other information on your level
is restricted.

877
01:18:02,262 --> 01:18:04,846
Open up in there. Open up in there.

878
01:18:05,807 --> 01:18:07,516
Oh, no.

879
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,226
There isn't any other way out.

880
01:18:14,774 --> 01:18:16,984
I can't hold them off forever. Now what?

881
01:18:17,068 --> 01:18:20,612
This is some rescue. When you came in here,
didn't you have a plan for getting out?

882
01:18:20,697 --> 01:18:22,739
He's the brains, sweetheart.

883
01:18:22,824 --> 01:18:24,575
Well, I didn't...

884
01:18:25,702 --> 01:18:29,246
- What the hell are you doing?
- Somebody has to save our skins.

885
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:33,250
Into the garbage chute, flyboy.

886
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:41,758
Get in there!

887
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:45,929
Get in there, you big furry oaf.
I don't care what you smell.

888
01:18:46,973 --> 01:18:49,474
Get in there, and don't worry about it.

889
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:52,978
Wonderful girl.

890
01:18:55,106 --> 01:18:58,317
Either I'm gonna kill her,
or I'm beginning to like her.

891
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:01,778
Get in there.

892
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:17,919
The garbage chute was
a really wonderful idea.

893
01:19:18,004 --> 01:19:20,464
What an incredible smell
you've discovered.

894
01:19:23,009 --> 01:19:25,260
Let's get out of here.

895
01:19:25,345 --> 01:19:27,679
- Get away from there.
- No, wait.

896
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:36,897
Forget it! I already tried it!
It's magnetically sealed.

897
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:39,232
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!

898
01:19:39,317 --> 01:19:41,276
Absolutely, Your Worship.

899
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:43,695
Look, I had everything under control
till you led us down here.

900
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:46,740
It's not gonna take 'em long
to figure out what happened to us.

901
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:48,116
It could be worse.

902
01:19:52,664 --> 01:19:53,955
It's worse.

903
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:57,125
- There's something alive in here.
- That's your imagination.

904
01:19:58,044 --> 01:20:00,003
Something just moved past my leg.

905
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:04,758
- Look. Did you see that?
- What?

906
01:20:26,406 --> 01:20:27,906
Kid! Luke!

907
01:20:40,712 --> 01:20:42,421
Grab hold of this!

908
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:44,923
Blast it! My gun's jammed.

909
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:47,759
- Where?
- Anywhere!

910
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:22,002
Help him!

911
01:21:22,086 --> 01:21:24,087
- What happened?
- I don't know.

912
01:21:24,172 --> 01:21:27,007
It just let go of me and disappeared.

913
01:21:33,014 --> 01:21:35,056
I got a bad feeling about this.

914
01:21:41,147 --> 01:21:44,316
- The walls are moving!
- Try and brace it with something.

915
01:21:53,284 --> 01:21:54,826
Help me.

916
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:09,216
Wait a minute.

917
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:14,304
3PO! Come in, 3PO!

918
01:22:15,515 --> 01:22:17,057
3PO!

919
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:19,184
Where could he be?

920
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:25,565
Take over. See to him.

921
01:22:28,027 --> 01:22:29,528
Look, there.

922
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:34,324
They're madmen.
They're heading for the prison level.

923
01:22:34,408 --> 01:22:36,326
If you hurry, you might catch them.

924
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:37,911
Follow me.

925
01:22:41,624 --> 01:22:43,667
You stand guard.

926
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,214
Come on.

927
01:22:57,515 --> 01:23:00,809
All this excitement has overrun
the circuits in my counterpart here.

928
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:04,020
If you don't mind, I'd like to
take him down to maintenance.

929
01:23:04,105 --> 01:23:05,689
All right.

930
01:23:17,869 --> 01:23:20,579
3PO. Come in, 3PO.

931
01:23:20,663 --> 01:23:21,955
3PO.

932
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:24,875
- Get on top.
- I can't.

933
01:23:24,959 --> 01:23:26,877
Where could he be? 3PO.

934
01:23:28,254 --> 01:23:30,088
3PO, will you come in?

935
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:33,091
They aren't here.
Something must have happened to them.

936
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:35,385
See if they've been captured. Hurry.

937
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:42,642
One thing's for sure.
We're all gonna be a lot thinner.

938
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:47,272
- Get on top of it.
- I'm trying.

939
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:55,989
Thank goodness they haven't found them.
Where could they be?

940
01:23:58,492 --> 01:24:00,869
"Use the comlink"? Oh, my.

941
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:02,913
I forgot. I turned it off.

942
01:24:07,084 --> 01:24:09,210
- Are you there, sir?
- 3PO?

943
01:24:10,171 --> 01:24:12,797
- We've had some problems.
- Shut up and listen to me.

944
01:24:12,882 --> 01:24:16,635
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level. Do you copy?

945
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:19,429
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

946
01:24:20,848 --> 01:24:23,516
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

947
01:24:23,601 --> 01:24:26,353
No, shut them all down. Hurry! Oh, no.

948
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:39,324
What?

949
01:24:40,368 --> 01:24:42,285
You did great, 3PO!

950
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:44,746
Listen to them. They're dying, R2.

951
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:46,831
Curse my metal body. I wasn't fast enough.

952
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:50,210
It's all my fault. My poor master.

953
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:51,878
We're all right. You did great!

954
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:56,675
Hey! Open the pressure maintenance hatch
on unit number... Where are we?

955
01:24:56,759 --> 01:25:00,136
3263827.

956
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:49,477
If we can avoid any more female advice,
we oughta be able to get out of here.

957
01:25:49,562 --> 01:25:51,438
Let's get moving.

958
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:54,816
Where you goin'?

959
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,401
Wait! They'll hear!

960
01:25:58,404 --> 01:26:00,321
Come here, you big coward.

961
01:26:00,406 --> 01:26:02,073
- Chewie, come here.
- Listen.

962
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:05,702
I don't know who you are
or where you came from...

963
01:26:05,786 --> 01:26:08,621
but from now on,
you do as I tell you, okay?

964
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:12,459
Look, Your Worshipfulness,
let's get one thing straight.

965
01:26:12,543 --> 01:26:15,211
I take orders from just one person... me.

966
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:17,839
It's a wonder you're still alive.

967
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:21,134
Will somebody get
this big walking carpet out of my way?

968
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:23,511
No reward is worth this.

969
01:26:33,731 --> 01:26:35,648
Give me regular reports, please.

970
01:26:35,733 --> 01:26:36,816
Right.

971
01:26:38,986 --> 01:26:42,280
- Do you know what's going on?
- Maybe it's another drill.

972
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:49,329
You seen that new VT-16?

973
01:26:49,413 --> 01:26:51,873
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.

974
01:26:51,957 --> 01:26:53,875
They say it's quite a thing to see.

975
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:55,960
What was that?

976
01:26:56,045 --> 01:26:59,297
It's nothing. Outgassing.
Don't worry about it.

977
01:27:04,303 --> 01:27:06,346
- There she is.
- C-3PO, do you copy?

978
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:07,514
Yes, sir.

979
01:27:07,598 --> 01:27:09,474
- Are you safe?
- For the moment.

980
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:11,935
We're in the main hangar
across from the ship.

981
01:27:13,896 --> 01:27:15,522
We're right above you. Stand by.

982
01:27:15,606 --> 01:27:18,399
You came in that thing?
You're braver than I thought.

983
01:27:18,484 --> 01:27:20,485
Nice. Come on.

984
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:25,782
It's them. Blast them.

985
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:28,785
Get back to the ship!

986
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:30,829
- Where are you going?
- He certainly has courage.

987
01:27:30,913 --> 01:27:34,624
What good will it do us
if he gets himself killed? Come on.

988
01:27:59,525 --> 01:28:01,526
I think we took a wrong turn.

989
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:07,407
There's no lock.

990
01:28:11,495 --> 01:28:14,414
- That oughta hold them for a while.
- Quick. We've got to get across.

991
01:28:14,498 --> 01:28:17,667
- Find the controls to extend the bridge.
- I think I just blasted it.

992
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:19,544
They're coming through.

993
01:28:41,901 --> 01:28:43,568
Here, hold this.

994
01:28:59,752 --> 01:29:00,960
Here they come.

995
01:29:12,348 --> 01:29:13,890
For luck.

996
01:29:20,022 --> 01:29:24,025
We think they may be splitting up.
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

997
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:40,875
Where could they be?

998
01:29:44,588 --> 01:29:46,506
Close the blast doors.

999
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:56,099
Open the blast doors.
Open the blast doors.

1000
01:30:14,451 --> 01:30:19,247
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.

1001
01:30:19,999 --> 01:30:21,708
The circle is now complete.

1002
01:30:21,792 --> 01:30:24,002
When I left you, I was but the learner.

1003
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:26,462
Now I am the master.

1004
01:30:26,547 --> 01:30:28,548
Only a master of evil, Darth.

1005
01:30:48,861 --> 01:30:51,154
Your powers are weak, old man.

1006
01:30:51,238 --> 01:30:54,907
You can't win, Darth.
If you strike me down...

1007
01:30:54,992 --> 01:30:58,369
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

1008
01:31:05,836 --> 01:31:07,879
You should not have come back.

1009
01:31:33,614 --> 01:31:35,239
Didn't we just leave this party?

1010
01:31:37,993 --> 01:31:40,244
- What kept you?
- We ran into some old friends.

1011
01:31:40,329 --> 01:31:42,830
- The ship all right?
- Seems okay, if we can get to it.

1012
01:31:42,915 --> 01:31:45,041
I hope the old man got
the tractor beam down.

1013
01:31:59,556 --> 01:32:00,765
Look.

1014
01:32:04,478 --> 01:32:06,437
Come on, R2. We're going.

1015
01:32:08,107 --> 01:32:09,232
Now's our chance. Go!

1016
01:32:39,346 --> 01:32:40,513
Come on!

1017
01:32:41,598 --> 01:32:43,057
Come on!

1018
01:32:43,142 --> 01:32:46,269
- Luke, it's too late!
- Blast the door, kid!

1019
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:57,447
Run, Luke, run.

1020
01:33:01,368 --> 01:33:05,830
I hope that old man got the tractor beam down,
or this is gonna be a short trip. Hit it!

1021
01:33:37,404 --> 01:33:39,322
We're coming up on their sentry ships.

1022
01:33:39,406 --> 01:33:42,825
Hold them off. Angle the deflector
shields while I charge up the main guns.

1023
01:33:52,002 --> 01:33:54,003
I can't believe he's gone.

1024
01:33:57,591 --> 01:33:59,425
There wasn't anything you could have done.

1025
01:34:00,219 --> 01:34:02,512
Come on, buddy. We're not out of this yet.

1026
01:34:19,238 --> 01:34:21,614
You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp.

1027
01:34:32,459 --> 01:34:33,584
Here they come.

1028
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:53,437
They're coming in too fast!

1029
01:35:01,446 --> 01:35:05,283
- We've lost the lateral controls.
- Don't worry. She'll hold together.

1030
01:35:06,785 --> 01:35:08,828
Hear me, baby? Hold together.

1031
01:35:30,934 --> 01:35:32,518
Got him. I got him!

1032
01:35:32,603 --> 01:35:35,021
Great, kid. Don't get cocky.

1033
01:35:36,189 --> 01:35:37,982
There's still two more.

1034
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:14,393
- That's it. We did it.
- We did it.

1035
01:36:15,646 --> 01:36:18,189
Help. I think I'm melting.
This is all your fault.

1036
01:36:25,947 --> 01:36:27,615
Are they away?

1037
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:30,076
They've just made the jump
into hyperspace.

1038
01:36:30,744 --> 01:36:34,163
You're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

1039
01:36:35,374 --> 01:36:37,750
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.

1040
01:36:37,834 --> 01:36:39,752
This had better work.

1041
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:42,088
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

1042
01:36:42,798 --> 01:36:45,883
You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.

1043
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:48,302
That doesn't sound too hard.

1044
01:36:48,387 --> 01:36:52,056
They let us go. It's the only
explanation for the ease of our escape.

1045
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:54,934
- You call that easy?
- They're tracking us.

1046
01:36:55,018 --> 01:36:56,852
Not this ship, sister.

1047
01:36:58,063 --> 01:37:00,606
At least the information in R2
is still intact.

1048
01:37:00,691 --> 01:37:03,150
What's so important? What's he carrying?

1049
01:37:03,235 --> 01:37:05,444
The technical readouts
of that battle station.

1050
01:37:06,446 --> 01:37:09,740
I only hope that when the data's
analyzed a weakness can be found.

1051
01:37:09,825 --> 01:37:13,202
- It's not over yet.
- It is for me, sister.

1052
01:37:13,286 --> 01:37:16,664
I ain't in this for your revolution,
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

1053
01:37:16,748 --> 01:37:19,625
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money.

1054
01:37:19,710 --> 01:37:21,919
You needn't worry about your reward.

1055
01:37:22,003 --> 01:37:24,922
If money is all that you love,
then that's what you'll receive.

1056
01:37:28,093 --> 01:37:30,010
Your friend is quite a mercenary.

1057
01:37:30,095 --> 01:37:33,347
I wonder if he really cares
about anything... or anybody.

1058
01:37:34,433 --> 01:37:35,933
I care.

1059
01:37:42,566 --> 01:37:44,191
So...

1060
01:37:44,276 --> 01:37:46,193
what do you think of her, Han?

1061
01:37:46,278 --> 01:37:48,154
I'm trying not to, kid.

1062
01:37:48,989 --> 01:37:50,281
Good.

1063
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:56,620
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

1064
01:37:58,707 --> 01:38:01,792
What do you think?
You think a princess and a guy like me...

1065
01:38:01,877 --> 01:38:02,501
No.

1066
01:38:50,133 --> 01:38:53,344
You're safe. When we heard about
Alderaan, we feared the worst.

1067
01:38:53,428 --> 01:38:55,346
We have no time for sorrows, Commander.

1068
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:58,432
You must use the information
in this R2 unit to help plan the attack.

1069
01:38:58,517 --> 01:39:00,518
It's our only hope.

1070
01:39:21,623 --> 01:39:24,333
- Yes.
- We're approaching the planet Yavin.

1071
01:39:24,417 --> 01:39:26,752
The rebel base is on a moon
on the far side.

1072
01:39:26,837 --> 01:39:28,838
We are preparing to orbit the planet.

1073
01:39:37,848 --> 01:39:39,932
The battle station is heavily shielded...

1074
01:39:40,016 --> 01:39:43,477
and carries a firepower
greater than half the starfleet.

1075
01:39:44,187 --> 01:39:48,274
Its defenses are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.

1076
01:39:48,358 --> 01:39:53,612
A small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defense.

1077
01:39:55,365 --> 01:39:59,159
Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good
are snub fighters against that?

1078
01:39:59,244 --> 01:40:03,831
The Empire doesn't consider a small,
one-man fighter to be any threat...

1079
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:05,916
or they'd have a tighter defense.

1080
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:10,045
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia...

1081
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:13,215
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

1082
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:16,010
The approach will not be easy.

1083
01:40:16,094 --> 01:40:19,263
You're required to maneuver
straight down this trench...

1084
01:40:19,347 --> 01:40:21,974
and skim the surface to this point.

1085
01:40:22,809 --> 01:40:25,519
The target area is only two meters wide.

1086
01:40:25,604 --> 01:40:29,273
It's a small thermal exhaust port
right below the main port.

1087
01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:33,736
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

1088
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:36,572
A precise hit
will start a chain reaction...

1089
01:40:36,656 --> 01:40:38,866
which should destroy the station.

1090
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:42,494
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

1091
01:40:42,579 --> 01:40:45,748
The shaft is ray-shielded,
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

1092
01:40:45,832 --> 01:40:48,000
That's impossible, even for a computer.

1093
01:40:48,084 --> 01:40:51,879
No, it's not. I used to bull's-eye
womp rats in my T-16 back home.

1094
01:40:51,963 --> 01:40:54,381
They're not much bigger than two meters.

1095
01:40:54,466 --> 01:40:57,635
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

1096
01:41:05,894 --> 01:41:08,479
Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.

1097
01:41:09,147 --> 01:41:12,858
The moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes.

1098
01:41:12,943 --> 01:41:15,569
This will be a day long remembered.

1099
01:41:15,654 --> 01:41:17,655
It has seen the end of Kenobi...

1100
01:41:17,739 --> 01:41:20,324
and will soon see
the end of the rebellion.

1101
01:41:26,081 --> 01:41:28,499
All flight crews, man your stations.

1102
01:41:34,798 --> 01:41:37,925
So, you got your reward
and you're just leaving, then?

1103
01:41:38,009 --> 01:41:40,010
That's right. Yeah.

1104
01:41:41,096 --> 01:41:43,722
I got some old debts
I gotta pay off with this stuff.

1105
01:41:43,807 --> 01:41:47,893
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be
fool enough to stick around here, do ya?

1106
01:41:47,978 --> 01:41:51,605
Why don't you come with us?
You're pretty good in a fight. We could use ya.

1107
01:41:51,690 --> 01:41:54,692
Come on. Why don't you take a look around?

1108
01:41:54,776 --> 01:41:57,444
You know what's about to happen,
what they're up against.

1109
01:41:57,529 --> 01:42:00,322
They could use a good pilot like you.
You're turning your back on them.

1110
01:42:00,407 --> 01:42:02,825
What good's a reward
if you ain't around to use it?

1111
01:42:02,909 --> 01:42:05,869
Besides, attacking that battle station
ain't my idea of courage.

1112
01:42:05,954 --> 01:42:08,872
It's more like... suicide.

1113
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:13,502
All right.
Well, take care of yourself, Han.

1114
01:42:13,586 --> 01:42:16,255
I guess that's what you're best at,
isn't it?

1115
01:42:16,339 --> 01:42:17,715
Hey, Luke.

1116
01:42:21,011 --> 01:42:23,387
May the Force be with you.

1117
01:42:29,894 --> 01:42:33,105
What are you looking at?
I know what I'm doing.

1118
01:42:37,527 --> 01:42:39,987
All pilots to your stations.

1119
01:42:48,913 --> 01:42:51,165
- What's wrong?
- It's Han.

1120
01:42:51,249 --> 01:42:53,751
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.

1121
01:42:53,835 --> 01:42:57,379
He's got to follow his own path.
No one can choose it for him.

1122
01:42:58,381 --> 01:43:00,841
I only wish Ben were here.

1123
01:43:08,850 --> 01:43:10,851
Open main launch tubes.

1124
01:43:11,853 --> 01:43:13,771
Main launch tubes opening, sir.

1125
01:43:13,855 --> 01:43:15,522
Hey, Luke!

1126
01:43:15,607 --> 01:43:18,817
- Biggs!
- I don't believe it. How are ya?

1127
01:43:18,902 --> 01:43:20,986
- Coming up?
- I'll be up there with you.

1128
01:43:21,071 --> 01:43:23,405
- Have I got stories to tell you.
- Skywalker.

1129
01:43:25,075 --> 01:43:26,992
Are you sure you can handle this ship?

1130
01:43:27,077 --> 01:43:30,496
Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot
in the outer-rim territories.

1131
01:43:31,206 --> 01:43:33,707
- You'll do all right.
- Thank you, sir. I'll try.

1132
01:43:33,792 --> 01:43:37,711
Gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your
stories when we get back, all right?

1133
01:43:37,796 --> 01:43:40,547
Hey, Biggs.
I told you I'd make it someday.

1134
01:43:40,632 --> 01:43:43,634
It'll be like old times, Luke.
They'll never stop us.

1135
01:43:46,513 --> 01:43:49,431
This R2 unit of yours seems
a bit beat up. You want a new one?

1136
01:43:49,516 --> 01:43:52,684
Not on your life. That droid and I
have been through a lot.

1137
01:43:52,769 --> 01:43:53,811
You okay, R2?

1138
01:43:55,438 --> 01:43:56,855
Good.

1139
01:43:57,899 --> 01:44:00,651
Gold squadron, begin takeoff procedure.

1140
01:44:01,319 --> 01:44:04,321
Hang on tight, R2.
You've got to come back.

1141
01:44:06,199 --> 01:44:08,200
You wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?

1142
01:44:56,541 --> 01:44:59,543
Luke, the Force will be with you.

1143
01:45:11,598 --> 01:45:15,100
Standby alert. Death Star approaching.

1144
01:45:15,185 --> 01:45:18,353
Estimated time to firing range,
15 minutes.

1145
01:45:31,451 --> 01:45:33,702
- All wings report in.
- Red 10 standing by.

1146
01:45:33,786 --> 01:45:36,038
- Red Seven standing by.
- Red Three standing by.

1147
01:45:36,122 --> 01:45:38,874
- Red Six standing by.
- Red Nine standing by.

1148
01:45:38,958 --> 01:45:41,001
- Red Two standing by.
- Red 11 standing by.

1149
01:45:41,085 --> 01:45:43,045
Red Five standing by.

1150
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:46,298
Lock S-foils in attack position.

1151
01:45:50,553 --> 01:45:52,554
We're passing through the magnetic field.

1152
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:55,432
Hold tight. Switch your deflectors on.

1153
01:45:55,516 --> 01:45:56,975
Double front.

1154
01:45:59,979 --> 01:46:01,772
Look at the size of that thing.

1155
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:04,483
Cut the chatter, Red Two.
Accelerate to attack speed.

1156
01:46:07,862 --> 01:46:10,614
- This is it, boys.
- Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1157
01:46:10,698 --> 01:46:13,575
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- We're starting for the target shaft.

1158
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:17,120
We're in position. I'm going to cut
across the axis and draw their fire.

1159
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:34,846
- Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.
- I see it. Stay low.

1160
01:46:42,272 --> 01:46:43,814
This is Red Five. I'm going in.

1161
01:46:48,361 --> 01:46:49,361
Luke, pull up!

1162
01:46:51,281 --> 01:46:53,365
- You all right?
- A little cooked, but I'm okay.

1163
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:03,250
We count 30 rebel ships, but they're so
small they're evading our turbolasers.

1164
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:05,252
We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.

1165
01:47:05,336 --> 01:47:07,462
Get the crews to their fighters.

1166
01:47:10,008 --> 01:47:13,885
Watch yourself. There's a lot of fire coming
from the right side of that deflection tower.

1167
01:47:13,970 --> 01:47:15,262
I'm on it.

1168
01:47:15,346 --> 01:47:18,807
- I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins.
- Right with you, Red Three.

1169
01:47:25,148 --> 01:47:26,940
I've got a problem here.

1170
01:47:27,025 --> 01:47:28,442
- Eject.
- I can hold it.

1171
01:47:28,526 --> 01:47:30,694
- Pull up!
- No, I'm all right...

1172
01:47:34,866 --> 01:47:37,868
The rebel base will be in firing range
in seven minutes.

1173
01:47:41,706 --> 01:47:44,374
Luke, trust your feelings.

1174
01:47:52,216 --> 01:47:53,842
Squad leaders...

1175
01:47:53,926 --> 01:47:55,969
we've picked up a new group of signals.

1176
01:47:56,054 --> 01:47:58,013
Enemy fighters coming your way.

1177
01:47:58,097 --> 01:47:59,806
My scope's negative. I don't see anything.

1178
01:47:59,891 --> 01:48:02,100
- Pick up your visual scanning.
- Here they come.

1179
01:48:05,355 --> 01:48:07,064
You've got one on your tail.

1180
01:48:12,403 --> 01:48:13,278
I'm hit!

1181
01:48:14,739 --> 01:48:17,282
- You've picked one up. Watch it.
- I can't see it.

1182
01:48:19,285 --> 01:48:21,036
He's on me tight. I can't shake him.

1183
01:48:22,705 --> 01:48:24,748
I'll be right there.

1184
01:48:36,928 --> 01:48:40,389
Several fighters have broken off
from the main group. Come with me.

1185
01:48:43,810 --> 01:48:46,937
- Fall in. Fall in.
- Watch your back, Luke.

1186
01:48:47,021 --> 01:48:49,398
Fighters above you, coming in.

1187
01:48:55,613 --> 01:48:58,365
I'm hit, but not bad.
R2, see what you can do with it.

1188
01:48:58,449 --> 01:49:00,617
Hang on back there.

1189
01:49:00,701 --> 01:49:03,370
Red Six, can you see Red Five?

1190
01:49:03,454 --> 01:49:05,872
There's a heavy fire zone.
Red Five, where are you?

1191
01:49:05,957 --> 01:49:07,416
I can't shake him.

1192
01:49:11,421 --> 01:49:12,963
I'm on him, Luke.

1193
01:49:16,175 --> 01:49:17,801
Blast it, Biggs. Where are you?

1194
01:49:24,809 --> 01:49:27,602
- Thanks, Wedge.
- Good shooting, Wedge.

1195
01:49:27,687 --> 01:49:30,814
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
We're starting our attack run.

1196
01:49:32,650 --> 01:49:35,026
I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position.

1197
01:49:37,447 --> 01:49:39,739
Stay in attack formation.

1198
01:49:39,824 --> 01:49:42,659
The exhaust port is marked and locked in.

1199
01:49:48,541 --> 01:49:51,710
Switch all power
to front deflector screen.

1200
01:49:51,794 --> 01:49:55,005
Switch all power
to front deflector screen.

1201
01:49:59,719 --> 01:50:01,470
How many guns do you think, Gold Five?

1202
01:50:01,554 --> 01:50:04,806
Say about 20 guns,
some on the surface, some on the towers.

1203
01:50:04,891 --> 01:50:07,726
Death Star will be in range
in five minutes.

1204
01:50:09,854 --> 01:50:12,898
Switch to targeting computer.

1205
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:17,360
Computer's locked. Getting a signal.

1206
01:50:19,697 --> 01:50:21,865
The guns. They've stopped.

1207
01:50:23,576 --> 01:50:26,119
Stabilize your rear deflectors.
Watch for enemy fighters.

1208
01:50:26,204 --> 01:50:28,705
They're coming in. Three marks at 210.

1209
01:50:30,666 --> 01:50:32,834
I'll take them myself. Cover me.

1210
01:50:32,919 --> 01:50:34,211
Yes, sir.

1211
01:50:48,726 --> 01:50:51,186
- It's no good. I can't maneuver.
- Stay on target.

1212
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:53,188
- We're too close.
- Stay on target.

1213
01:50:54,941 --> 01:50:55,899
Loosen up!

1214
01:50:58,903 --> 01:51:01,780
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

1215
01:51:01,864 --> 01:51:04,241
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- They came from behind.

1216
01:51:10,581 --> 01:51:13,208
We've analyzed their attack, sir,
and there is a danger.

1217
01:51:13,292 --> 01:51:15,210
Should I have your ship standing by?

1218
01:51:15,294 --> 01:51:18,171
Evacuate? In our moment of triumph?

1219
01:51:18,256 --> 01:51:20,757
I think you overestimate their chances.

1220
01:51:21,425 --> 01:51:23,468
Rebel base, three minutes and closing.

1221
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:26,096
Red boys, this is Red Leader.

1222
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:27,889
Rendezvous at mark 6. 1.

1223
01:51:27,974 --> 01:51:31,518
- This is Red Two flying toward you.
- Red Three standing by.

1224
01:51:31,602 --> 01:51:33,562
Red Leader, this is Base One.

1225
01:51:33,646 --> 01:51:36,314
Keep half your group out of range
for the next run.

1226
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:39,025
Copy, Base One.
Luke, take Red Two and Three.

1227
01:51:39,110 --> 01:51:42,445
Hold up here and wait for
my signal to start your run.

1228
01:51:50,913 --> 01:51:52,122
This is it.

1229
01:51:56,669 --> 01:51:58,795
We should be able to see it by now.

1230
01:52:00,464 --> 01:52:02,257
Keep your eyes open for those fighters.

1231
01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:06,428
There's too much interference.
Red Five, can you see them?

1232
01:52:06,512 --> 01:52:09,514
- No sign of any... Wait. Coming in .35.
- I see them.

1233
01:52:11,058 --> 01:52:12,142
I'm in range.

1234
01:52:13,436 --> 01:52:15,145
Target's coming up.

1235
01:52:17,732 --> 01:52:19,858
Just hold them off for a few seconds.

1236
01:52:20,693 --> 01:52:22,319
Close up formation.

1237
01:52:23,654 --> 01:52:25,822
Almost there.

1238
01:52:34,915 --> 01:52:38,168
- Let her loose. They're right behind me.
- Almost there.

1239
01:52:39,545 --> 01:52:41,212
I can't hold them.

1240
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:50,180
It's away!

1241
01:52:54,685 --> 01:52:56,311
- It's a hit!
- Negative.

1242
01:52:56,395 --> 01:52:58,480
Negative. It didn't go in.

1243
01:52:58,564 --> 01:53:01,232
It just impacted on the surface.

1244
01:53:07,698 --> 01:53:09,366
Red Leader, we're right above you.

1245
01:53:09,450 --> 01:53:11,618
Turn to .05. We'll cover for you.

1246
01:53:11,702 --> 01:53:14,663
Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.

1247
01:53:15,456 --> 01:53:17,707
Get set up for your attack run.

1248
01:53:31,055 --> 01:53:33,682
Rebel base, one minute and closing.

1249
01:53:34,392 --> 01:53:35,975
Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.

1250
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:39,437
We're going in full throttle. That ought
to keep those fighters off our back.

1251
01:53:39,522 --> 01:53:41,648
Right with you, boss.

1252
01:53:41,732 --> 01:53:44,025
At that speed,
will you be able to pull out in time?

1253
01:53:44,110 --> 01:53:46,111
It'll be just like
Beggars Canyon back home.

1254
01:53:53,452 --> 01:53:55,704
We'll stay back far enough to cover you.

1255
01:53:55,788 --> 01:53:58,373
My scope shows the tower,
but l can't see the exhaust port.

1256
01:53:58,457 --> 01:53:59,916
Are you sure the computer can hit it?

1257
01:54:03,421 --> 01:54:05,422
Watch yourself.
Increase speed, full throttle.

1258
01:54:05,506 --> 01:54:06,798
What about that tower?

1259
01:54:06,882 --> 01:54:09,300
You worry about those fighters.
I'll worry about the tower.

1260
01:54:15,725 --> 01:54:19,310
R2, that stabilizer's broken loose
again. See if you can't lock it down.

1261
01:54:28,487 --> 01:54:30,280
Fighters coming in .3.

1262
01:54:39,206 --> 01:54:41,708
- I'm hit. I can't stay with you.
- Get clear, Wedge.

1263
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:44,294
- You can't do any more good back there.
- Sorry.

1264
01:54:45,337 --> 01:54:47,297
Let him go. Stay on the leader.

1265
01:54:50,259 --> 01:54:52,469
Hurry, Luke.
They're coming in much faster this time.

1266
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:59,350
R2, try and increase the power.

1267
01:55:04,732 --> 01:55:05,982
Hurry up, Luke. Quick.

1268
01:55:06,901 --> 01:55:08,026
Quick.

1269
01:55:15,075 --> 01:55:17,619
Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.

1270
01:55:17,703 --> 01:55:18,828
I'm on the leader.

1271
01:55:22,291 --> 01:55:23,792
Hang on, R2.

1272
01:55:39,183 --> 01:55:41,768
Use the Force, Luke.

1273
01:55:44,396 --> 01:55:47,023
Let go, Luke.

1274
01:55:48,484 --> 01:55:50,860
The Force is strong with this one.

1275
01:55:50,945 --> 01:55:52,904
Luke, trust me.

1276
01:55:58,077 --> 01:55:59,911
His computer's off.

1277
01:55:59,995 --> 01:56:02,121
You switched off your
targeting computer. What's wrong?

1278
01:56:02,206 --> 01:56:04,874
Nothing. I'm all right.

1279
01:56:17,805 --> 01:56:19,055
I've lost R2.

1280
01:56:20,891 --> 01:56:23,017
The Death Star has cleared the planet.

1281
01:56:23,102 --> 01:56:25,436
The Death Star has cleared the planet.

1282
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:28,106
Rebel base in range.

1283
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:30,108
You may fire when ready.

1284
01:56:30,818 --> 01:56:32,277
Commence primary ignition.

1285
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:47,709
I have you now.

1286
01:56:50,129 --> 01:56:51,296
What?

1287
01:56:53,924 --> 01:56:54,757
Look out.

1288
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:04,434
You're all clear, kid.
Now let's blow this thing and go home.

1289
01:57:11,275 --> 01:57:12,609
Stand by.

1290
01:57:15,613 --> 01:57:17,322
Stand by.

1291
01:57:27,791 --> 01:57:29,751
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!

1292
01:57:31,128 --> 01:57:35,632
Remember, the Force
will be with you always.

1293
01:58:00,991 --> 01:58:02,867
I just knew you'd come back.

1294
01:58:02,952 --> 01:58:05,495
I wasn't gonna let you get all
the credit and take all the reward.

1295
01:58:05,579 --> 01:58:07,538
I knew there was more to you than money.

1296
01:58:08,207 --> 01:58:09,499
Oh, no.

1297
01:58:09,583 --> 01:58:12,043
Oh, my. R2, can you hear me?

1298
01:58:12,711 --> 01:58:15,588
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?

1299
01:58:15,673 --> 01:58:18,925
- We'll get to work on him right away.
- You must repair him.

1300
01:58:19,009 --> 01:58:21,928
Sir, if any of my circuits or gears
will help, I'll gladly donate them.

1301
01:58:22,012 --> 01:58:24,013
He'll be all right.

1302
02:04:40,724 --> 02:04:41,724
English - US
